<small>PERHAPS LOVERS ONCE, STRANGERS NOW.</small></h2>


<p>The genial summer sun had long since dropped behind
the Irish hills, and the glowing lights of old Dublin were
set like rare jewels upon the dark bosom of mother earth
when Roderic Owen, with a fragrant cigar between his
teeth, walked to and fro under the shadow of Nelson's
column in historic Sackville street, now better known
among loyal citizens under the name of O'Connell.</p>

<p>Owen only arrived from Liverpool on the Holyhead
steamer that very day and had passed some hours upon
various tramcars, surveying those portions of the famous
city they traversed.</p>

<p>It may have given him a thrill of satisfaction to realize
that he once more stood on his native heath, which land
the exile had not seen since, a child of tender years, he
left it in company with his heart broken parents; but two
decades in the atmosphere of free America had made a
full-fledged Yankee out of him, and his heart was wholly
pledged to the interests of America.</p>

<p>Business had more to do with his flying visit across the
Irish sea than a desire to look upon the scenes of childhood&mdash;these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
tender recollections might be all very good
in their way, but when his country was at war with one
of the old world powers, young Owen's heart and soul
were wrapped up in the interests he represented, and the
state mission that had taken him over the Atlantic.</p>

<p>The public will never learn more than a small portion
of the unwritten history of the Hispano-American war,
since these memoirs are snugly reposing in the archives at
Washington, where they will rest until dusty with age.</p>

<p>Secret agents were employed in many European capitals
in the endeavor to discover the true sentiments of the
powers most interested, so that in case unhappy Spain
seemed in a way to secure an ally, prompt measures might
be taken to head off the threatened blow by a sudden
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup d'etat</i>, in which our good friend Great Britain stood
ready to do her part.</p>

<p>Roderic Owen, being peculiarly gifted by nature with
rare abilities in the line of diplomacy, had been remarkably
useful in Berlin, Paris and Vienna, and was now suddenly
transferred to another famous capital because it appeared
as though Dublin might be the theatre of a little gathering
where matters of intense moment were to be discussed.</p>

<p>It was evident from his manner that he had made the
Nelson column a rendezvous. His eyes followed each
tramcar that passed, and never a jaunting-car jogged by
that he did not survey with growing interest. A hot
blooded Spanish lover awaiting the coming of the black-eyed
senorita with whom he had made a tryst could hardly
have appeared more anxious.</p>

<p>He had just tossed away the remnant of his weed and
was feeling for his cigar case to draw out another when
the expected happened.</p>

<p>"At last!" he muttered, with a sigh of relief.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>Still he made no abrupt forward movement&mdash;caution
had been one of the fruits of long diplomatic service.
"Everything comes to him who waits&mdash;and works," is
the leading maxim of their craft.</p>

<p>A woman dismounted from a Rathmines car that
had just arrived at the terminus of its journey. She was
garbed in the sombre black habiliments of a religious recluse
belonging to one of the many orders in Dublin.
These nuns, serving often in the capacity of Sisters of
Charity, come and go with the utmost freedom, respected
by the humble classes to whom they are often angelic messengers
in times of distress or sickness.</p>

<p>Just as he expected the sombre robed passenger came
slowly toward him as though endeavoring to make sure of
his identity ere accosting him.</p>

<p>Owen could <em>feel</em> a pair of eager eyes fastened upon
his face, for there is such a sensation, and it surprised him
to experience it.</p>

<p>Then came a low voice breathing his name, and somehow
it had never before sounded just the same to him,
nor had he known there was music in its bare utterance.</p>

<p>"I have waited about half an hour for you," remarked
the American, complacently.</p>

<p>"Ah! senor, I am sorry. It was not my fault I assure
you," she exclaimed, eagerly.</p>

<p>"I am certain of that, lady. Besides, I have no right to
complain when one whom I do not even know goes to this
great trouble in order to do me a service."</p>

<p>She moved uneasily at his words, and as if fearful lest
his ardent gaze might penetrate beneath the veil she wore,
one little white hand crept out from the folds of her sable
robe to rearrange the crepe.</p>

<p>Owen smiled, for this act of caution had revealed much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
to him&mdash;upon those plump fingers shone rings set with
flashing gems, such as no member of a holy order would
dare wear.</p>

<p>Thus, without asking a question, he knew his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vis-&agrave;-vis</i>
to be in disguise.</p>

<p>More than this, the unconscious desire to make sure
that her face was concealed gave him the impression that
they must have met before. As yet her voice had only
sounded in low, whispered cadence, but it was rich and
musical, and somehow seemed to arouse dim, uncertain
memories which in good time after much groping, he
would doubtless be able to place.</p>

<p>She looked around with some concern, for the locality
being central was never quiet, upon which he said:</p>

<p>"Let us walk toward O'Connell bridge, and you can
explain more fully the meaning of your note, as you promised.
I assure you the interest taken in my welfare is
appreciated, and if I can return the favor you have only
to speak."</p>

<p>"You mistake, senor&mdash;I do not seek a reward. Chancing
to know that you were the object of a base plot, I
thought it only my duty to warn you."</p>

<p>"Because your vows constrained you?"</p>

<p>She appeared somewhat annoyed.</p>

<p>"Because heaven inspires every honest heart to desire
the confusion of evil schemes."</p>

<p>"Pardon&mdash;I was foolish for an instant to believe my
personality could have anything to do with it. Undoubtedly
your love of fair play must have impelled you to do
the same for any poor devil."</p>

<p>"Senor, you have no right to question my motives."</p>

<p>"I am a brute&mdash;you are an angel come to my assistance.
Let us then proceed to business. From whence does this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
threatening danger come&mdash;in which quarter am I to guard
against secret foes?"</p>

<p>"You do not seem to be alarmed?"</p>

<p>"Does that surprise you, lady? Surely then you are
not well acquainted with Anglo-Saxon blood. We who
sup with danger, learn to despise it. I say this deliberately
and without boasting."</p>

<p>"Ah! yes, I had forgotten your mission abroad. Your
government would never have sent any but a brave cavalier
to take such desperate chances. <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Hola!</i> it is a pleasure
to meet a man who does not shrink from a hazard."</p>

<p>"Pardon the curiosity&mdash;but are you not Spanish?" he
asked, steadily&mdash;it was of considerable importance that he
should know this fact, for the most able diplomat may
well look to his laurels when pitted against a female
Richelieu.</p>

<p>She answered frankly, almost eagerly.</p>

<p>"My people are of Spanish blood, but I have only once
seen Spain. I am <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">hija de Puerto Rico</i>."</p>

<p>How proudly she declared it.</p>

<p>"A daughter of Porto Rico&mdash;I am pleased to know it,
for that lovely island will soon rest beneath the starry
banner. A grand future awaits her under the new dispensation.
I have been in San Juan myself, and shall
never cease to remember that quaint city."</p>

<p>Perhaps the evening breeze brought with it a breath of
chilly fog from off old Dublin bay&mdash;at any rate the wearer
of the sombre nun's garb shivered a little and seemed to
shrink back from the American.</p>

<p>"Now," continued Owen, cheerily, as though his quick
eye had not noted with considerable surprise this peculiar
action on her part, "we have reached the bridge. Tell me
whence comes this danger?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>"There is one whom you have believed a friend, Senor
Owen. Trust him not, for he has sworn to work your
downfall."</p>

<p>"Which is very interesting, to say the least. Am I to
be arrested as a Fenian suspect, come over the big pond
to duplicate the Burke and Cavendish tragedy of Ph&oelig;nix
park? Or is this sly schemer a Spanish sympathizer in
the pay of Sagasta?"</p>

<p>"You have said it, senor&mdash;the last is the truth. But
there is more&mdash;another reason why he hates you."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you wouldn't mind mentioning it?"</p>

<p>"His name first&mdash;it is Jerome Wellington."</p>

<p>Owen seemed startled.</p>

<p>"Confusion&mdash;I never suspected that <em>he</em> was in Sagasta's
pay. Luckily I have made it a rule to be as close mouthed
as an oyster with regard to all state secrets. So friend
Jerome has a private grudge against me. When have I
trod upon his toes? Kindly enlighten me, good angel?"</p>

<p>"It is on her account&mdash;the dashing Senorita Cleo," came
the muffled answer, and again Owen knew the eyes back
of the veil were fastened intently upon him as though to
read his secret.</p>

<p>Thereupon he pursed up his mustached lip and emitted
a low, incredulous whistle.</p>

<p>"Cleo Fairfax, my independent cousin, the daughter of
ten millions, what has she to do with the case? Is Jerome
jealous&mdash;does he seek her hand&mdash;well, let him sail in and
win. I shall not stand in the way, for it has never occurred
to me to fall in love with my cousin."</p>

<p>"Ah! senor, that is very well, but this man who is as
handsome as an Adonis hates you because he knows the
American senorita loves you."</p>

<p>"What! Cleo loves me&mdash;incredible&mdash;impossible."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>"More, she adores you."</p>

<p>"Senorita, you surely jest or dream."</p>

<p>"I speak what I know, and the fact is patent to everyone
that you have but to declare a word to bring this lovely
girl and her millions to your arms."</p>

<p>"God forbid that I should ever speak that word, unless
I truly loved her as a man should the girl he means to
make his wife. It is, I say again, impossible that such a
thing can be."</p>

<p>"Few things are impossible, senor."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;there are impediments in the way."</p>

<p>"Perhaps none that might not be swept aside."</p>

<p>"Above all, I do not love her&mdash;it is ridiculous, and
never entered into my mind. And so Jerome has conjured
up a delightful hatred for me because, by Jove, he
chooses to <em>imagine</em>&mdash;you see I lay especial emphasis on
that word, for I can't believe it possible&mdash;that this favored
daughter of fortune gives me more than cousinly regard.
Well, if it pleases Jerome to indulge in such capers, I'm
not the one to cry quits. My duty as well as my privilege
is to meet him half way. I imagine you may be in a position
to tell me how he means to strike. It is awful kind
of you to take such trouble."</p>

<p>The thought had suddenly occurred to him that perhaps
she might have come from Cleo, and he winced at the
verbatim report of his declaration she must necessarily
take back; but it was the truth, and Roderic Owen had
always made a point to stick to his guns in action.</p>

<p>She was growing uneasy, as though fearful lest he
might allow his curiosity respecting her identity get the
better of his gentlemanly instincts. So when she spoke
again it was hurriedly, her manner betraying a desire to
end the interview.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have gone so far that it only remains for me to tell
you the nature of the plot whereby this jealous fortune
seeker hopes not only to ruin you in the eyes of the
Senorita Cleo, but before your government as well.</p>

<p>"You are staying at the Shelbourne hotel. Your room
overlooks the cascade in St. Stevens green. You have
arranged to meet one at the park gate at twelve to-night,
expecting to receive information respecting the clique of
Spanish sympathizers at present sojourning in Dublin as
a city least suspected of harboring America's foes. They
have come here in the hope of arousing the slumbering
Fenian spirit should Great Britain join the states against
France or Germany.</p>

<p>"Your expected informant is in their pay&mdash;he intends to
suddenly pounce upon you and, aided by allies in hiding
carry you off. It will be made to appear that you have
abandoned your patriotic mission, and fled with a well
known adventuress to the gaming tables of Monte Carlo."</p>

<p>"The duse! This is a nice kettle of fish. And only
for you I might have fallen a victim of the plot. But forewarned
is forearmed. Some one shall take my place,
since it would be a pity they should have their labor for
nothing. It shall be diamond cut diamond from this
hour. And now, believe me, I am duly sensible of the
great service you had done me, lady. God knows it would
give me pleasure to reciprocate should the occasion ever
arise."</p>

<p>"I believe it&mdash;I know it, Senor Owen," she said, with
some confusion.</p>

<p>"I do not ask your name&mdash;that you wish it to remain a
secret is enough for me. But at least you will shake hands
before we part. It is a part of an American's code, you
know&mdash;add one more obligation to those you have heaped
upon me. Do not refuse, I beg."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>She had shrunk back as though alarmed at the prospect,
but his <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'debonnair'"><i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">debonair</i></ins> manner, together with the absurdity of
the fear that almost overwhelmed her seemed to force her
to meet his friendly advances, and a little hand crept shyly
out from among the dusky robes, advancing half way.</p>

<p>Roderic Owen clasped it in his own, and was conscious
of a most remarkable sensation that seemed to flash along
his arm until it finally brought up in the region of his
heart.</p>

<p>It may have been electricity, or some kindred element,
but all the same he considered it exceeding queer.</p>

<p>Perhaps in his warmth he pressed her hand so that the
setting of her rings inflicted pain. At any rate she gave
a little exclamation.</p>

<p>"Forgive me; I forgot your rings, idiot that I am," and
with a gallantry he must have inherited from ancestors
who once ruled in this ever green isle he hastily raised the
bruised digits to his lips.</p>

<p>This caused her to snatch away her hand and with a
hasty "<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">buenos noches</i>" hurry to meet a tramcar coming
from the monument.</p>

<p>Before Owen could fully recover from his surprise she
had entered the double decked vehicle of transportation,
and was lost to his sight.</p>

<p>He stood there, leaning against the stone railing of
O'Connell bridge and looking after the car, a very much
puzzled man.</p>

<p>"Ah!" he ejaculated, as snatching out his handkerchief
he waved it vigorously in response to the one that fluttered
from the open window of the humble tramcar.</p>

<p>Then the man from over the sea mechanically drew out
his cigar case, selected a weed, struck a match on the stone
coping of the bridge, and began to puff away as though he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
might in this manner free his brain of the mental cobwebs
that seemed to clog his clear reasoning.</p>

<p>At the same time he started in the direction of Trinity
College, swinging a stout cane, and musing upon the singular
events that had on this night opened a new chapter
in his experience.</p>

<p>And somehow it seemed to the adventurous Owen that
they bore a definite connection with his past&mdash;again he
heard that voice sounding as with the music of sweet birds&mdash;its
dim echo, so familiar and yet eluding his grasp like
a fluttering will-o'-the-wisp, how exasperating it was.
Where had he met this seeming nun in the sable robe, and
who was she?</p>

<p>Then suddenly he saw a great light&mdash;the confused
memories drifted into one clear vision. Again he stood
on the brilliantly lighted Grand Plaza of the Porto Rican
capital with surging crowds of officers and civilians
around him, while a really excellent military band played
the beautiful, voluptuous airs of sunny Spain&mdash;again he
heard a voice, sweet as that of a lark, floating upon the
night air from an open window, and singing a serenade&mdash;Roderic
was carried back two years in his life to scenes
that had been marked by stormy passion, and the realization
gave him a tremendous shock.</p>

<p>He had reached the vicinity of Trinity's bold Campanile
when this bolt went home, and the effect was so great as
to actually bring him to a full stop, with held breath.</p>

<p>"By Jove! to think I never suspected the amazing truth
when talking with her. Now I know it, I can swear to
it&mdash;the same voice, which I have never heard equaled.
And she has done this thing for <em>me</em>, Roderic Owen, whom
possibly she has reason to hate. Heavens! there is some
fatality back of it all, and we are but puppets on life's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
great stage, playing our little parts automatically. God
alone sees the end. Yes, that was Georgia de Brabant,
the charming maid of San Juan, over whom half the
Spanish officers raved, about whom more than a few duels
were fought, and with whose fate my own life thread
became entangled in a way that has forever prevented my
loving cousin Cleo or any other woman. The past then is
<em>not</em> dead&mdash;again she enters my life&mdash;she comes like an
angel of light to save me from being made the victim of
a foul plot. That would indicate anything but hate.
What lies before me mortal cannot guess, but my duty is
clear, and come weal come woe, I am bound to serve my
country first, last and always, no matter what the sacrifice.
And ye gods, I kissed the hand whereon perhaps
dazzled <em>his</em> rings."</p>

<small>ALAS! FOR THE GAME THAT FAILED TO WORK.</small></h2>


<p>Evidently Roderic Owen was disturbed by this meeting
more than he would have cared to confess. When
ghosts that are supposed to have been laid for all time
come back to haunt us, memory plays havoc with the
strongest resolutions. Owen lived again in the past&mdash;his
ears seemed to drink in the music and merriment of the
gay Spanish-American capital&mdash;he saw once more a face
that had been enshrined in his heart as queen of the realm,
and somehow the memory was not so unpleasant. Instead
of groaning over the disasters of the past he found himself
unconsciously building new <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chateaux d'Espagne</i>.
Hope ever abides in the human breast&mdash;though daily overthrown
it rises again and again, Ph&oelig;nix like from the
ashes, and builds anew.</p>

<p>From the shadow of Trinity College and the Bank of
Ireland, formerly the Irish House of Parliament, it was
but a short distance to his hotel, the luxurious Shelbourne.</p>

<p>Having once entered the caravansary he cast his eyes
around as though seeking some one. A number of gentlemen
lounged near the booking offices, while on the first
landing of the wide stairs among palms and flowers ladies
could be seen.</p>

<p>It was a bright picture, entirely foreign to the usual run
of transatlantic hotels to which Owen was accustomed.</p>

<p>A pair of bright eyes detected his arrival and a fair
hand beckoned him upward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>Time was of value to him, but when beauty demands
attendance other things may wait, and he believed he
could spare a few minutes at any rate.</p>

<p>She was a remarkable young woman, this Cleopatra
Fairfax, and few men could have resisted her charms of
person and fortune. True, in features she could not be
called beautiful, but her eyes were glorious blue ones, her
hair abundant and of a golden hue, while her skin was
browned by exposure to sun and wind, since M'lle Cleo
was a confirmed golf player, a bicyclist, and a voyager
over many seas. Her form at least was enough like that
of Venus to set many a famous painter anxious because
his last models lacked those qualities which a lavish Nature
had showered so abundantly on this child of fortune.</p>

<p>This then was Cousin Cleo, an impulsive, warm-hearted
girl, with the better qualities of both Irish and American
ancestors in her veins.</p>

<p>Her mother had been an Owen, while on her father's
side she came from a long line of the famous Virginia
Fairfax family. A better combination it would be hard
to imagine; and in this coming together of old and new
world blood lies the wonderful strength and marvelous
ingenuity of the American people.</p>

<p>Miss Fairfax traveled withersoever her sweet will
prompted, always accompanied by a spinster chaperone.
Perhaps it was an accident that brought her to Dublin and
the Shelbourne at the same time the English Ambassador's
private agent took up his quarters there&mdash;these accidents,
how often they happen, and how opportunely at
times.</p>

<p>Besides the motherly chaperone, there was another in
the party, a gentleman who in physique and handsome
features far outshone Roderic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>Of course this was Jerome Wellington, a man of the
world, belonging to a good family and now of a mind to
settle down after having sown a magnificent crop of wild
oats.</p>

<p>Naturally when such a dasher thus resolves to give up
his freedom, he looks around for a girl whose income will
forever preclude any and all possibility of his ever being
compelled to live upon his wits again.</p>

<p>With ten millions more or less at her beck and nod,
Miss Fairfax of Virginia offered grand opportunities in
this line, and accordingly the Adonis who had seldom
known what it was to fail had sworn a mighty oath that
ere twelve moons had waxed and waned M'lle Cleo
would have changed her name to the equally aristocratic
one of Wellington.</p>

<p>Then he struck a snag.</p>

<p>He discovered that Cleo had since childhood cherished
a deep and romantic fancy for Roderic Owen.</p>

<p>They had romped together, and as years fled the stalwart
young man became her hero. She blindly adored
him, and being so frank and open by nature, her secret
was easily read by such an acute observer as Jerome,
though the object of this affection had somehow never
dreamed that he was regarded in any other than a cousinly
way.</p>

<p>If Jerome had a strong point of which he was particularly
proud it was his connection with divers deep and
dark plots. He regarded himself in the light of a modern
Machiavelli, and was never really happy unless dabbling
in mysterious affairs.</p>

<p>In his day he had been Carlist, Anarchist, Socialist,
Nihilist and heaven knows what not.</p>

<p>Hence, it was to him a very insignificant matter to figure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
out how he should wipe this interloper from his path.
Bah! it was almost too easy a task for one of his magnificent
intellect, brightened by contact with the greatest
schemers of the world. However, the stake was a glorious
one, and even trifles must be carefully looked after
if success is desired.</p>

<p>So Jerome had set the machinery in motion which he
expected would speedily eliminate his rival from the field.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for himself he did not consider that he
was now up against a man whom Nature had abundantly
endowed with common sense and shrewdness, and who as
a secret service officer in charge of matters of state had
gained considerable praise from the Honorable Secretary
at Washington under whose direction he labored.</p>

<p>Besides, Jerome's objections had undoubtedly been
hitherto conducted against European wits, and he might
find wide awake Yankee minds constructed on a somewhat
different order.</p>

<p>Roderic chatted and laughed pleasantly for a little time,
as though on the best of terms with himself and every
one else in the world.</p>

<p>Then, pleading business he tore himself away.</p>

<p>Now that his attention had been forcibly brought to
bear upon the subject he could not but note the blushes
that mantled his cousin's face upon his addressing any
remark directly to her, and the look of reproach she bestowed
upon him when he left the gay party.</p>

<p>All of which gave him pain instead of pleasure.</p>

<p>The happiness of this cousin was of much moment in
his eyes.</p>

<p>She had always laughingly declared her intention never
to marry whenever he broached the subject of the right
cavalier coming along, and up to the present Roderic had
been dense enough not to suspect the truth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>It was just like a man at any rate.</p>

<p>But at the same time it reflected on his extreme modesty.</p>

<p>Jerome called out a joking farewell after him, which
appeared harmless enough, but with his knowledge of the
man's evil intentions Roderic was able to read between the
lines and see the malevolence exposed.</p>

<p>"He laughs loudest who laughs last, my dear Jerome,"
he muttered as he walked away from the hotel, "and it
remains to be seen how your game comes out. Heretofore
I have considered the man a mere every day adventurer,
attracted by the glitter of Cleo's gold, and believing
she knew how to handle such fellows without gloves, did
not think it my duty to interfere. Now that it begins to
look more serious I find I shall be compelled to throw my
castor into the ring, and take up cudgels in her defense.
God bless her, a man could not well have a stronger inspiration
to do his level best. How the duse I have failed
to fall head over heels in love with Cleo all these years I
am at a loss to understand, yet somehow I have had an affection
for the dear girl such as one entertains for a sister.
Now my eyes are opened, and it is I fear quite too
late. Destiny has already wrought out my future for
good or evil."</p>

<p>He was thinking again of San Juan with its park, its
glittering lights, its military music and the flash of many
dark Spanish eyes.</p>

<p>Yes, Roderic was quite right.</p>

<p>It was too late!</p>

<p>He could never offer Cleo or any other woman the first
passion of his heart, since that had gone out under the
palms and flower scented bowers of the Antilles to a
daughter of Porto Rico.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>He sighed as he relegated these things, both pleasant
and painful, once more to oblivion, and again rallied his
forces to grapple with the game on hand.</p>

<p>Just around the corner he came across a man advancing
toward the hotel, and whom he hailed.</p>

<p>"Well met, Darby&mdash;I was on the way to hunt you up,
while you seem headed for my quarters."</p>

<p>"Just so, sir," replied the other, who appeared a man
of few words, and evidently one in whom Owen placed
much confidence.</p>

<p>"You complained recently of rusting&mdash;that everything
seemed so dull and dead. As fortune has it I am now in
a position to offer you a little excitement, and at the same
time you may be of great service to me."</p>

<p>Darby nodded his head&mdash;he was a man of ice, whom
nothing could excite, and yet to whom action was as the
air he breathed.</p>

<p>Knowing the nature of the man so well, Owen struck
directly into his story, and ere many minutes had flown
the other was as well acquainted with the facts as himself.</p>

<p>One feature alone he repressed.</p>

<p>This was the attachment on Cleo's part for so unworthy
an individual as himself&mdash;that was too sacred to be given
over as common property.</p>

<p>Darby would have to guess a reason for the hatred of
Wellington&mdash;perhaps he might lay it to the Spanish sympathies
of the other, which induced him to seek Dublin
in order to have a hand in the mysterious conference with
pronounced Fenian leaders; or it might be his sagacity
would suggest the only plausible explanation.</p>

<p>Thus the story was told.</p>

<p>"Quite a neat little affair," commented Darby.</p>

<p>"Will you take my place?" asked Owen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>The other's face showed no sign of emotion.</p>

<p>"Just so, sir."</p>

<p>"You may bring up in Monte Carlo or Hong Kong,
with a fascinating adventuress professing to be madly infatuated
with you."</p>

<p>This time the faintest flicker of a smile appeared.</p>

<p>"A dreadful fate, truly, sir."</p>

<p>"Still you do not shrink from it, Darby?"</p>

<p>The Sphinx shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Duty is duty, sir. I shall play the cards to win."</p>

<p>"You are to represent me&mdash;for the time you will look
and act and think as Roderic Owen."</p>

<p>"I leave it to you whether I am able."</p>

<p>"My dear fellow there is nothing you could not accomplish,
if you set your mind to it. I warrant that even
Jerome will be deceived should he personally take a hand
in the game of abduction."</p>

<p>"He will know the truth to-morrow when he meets you
here?"</p>

<p>"True&mdash;and will be stunned, unable to comprehend the
facts. Thus, you will be at liberty to do as you please
after once reaching French territory. You know how to
find me again."</p>

<p>"Just so, sir. Is that all?"</p>

<p>"Only that I wish you the best of success," taking the
cold hand of the Sphinx and squeezing it.</p>

<p>There was actually a faint response.</p>

<p>And yet strange to say, this naturally reserved and
passionless man was so great an actor that when duty
compelled he could imitate even the most hot-blooded
Spanish wooer, and sue with song and story for a dusky
senorita's love.</p>

<p>That was genius rising above nature, a carefully trained
gift such as few men possess.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>"The hour grows late, and you will need some time to
make your preparations, so there is no need of my detaining
you longer. As to money&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I have more than enough, sir."</p>

<p>"Good. Besides, if you turn up at Monte Carlo you
may have a chance to apply some of the tactics you once
used in breaking a faro bank in New Orleans. It would
perhaps be rare sport to you for a change."</p>

<p>Again Darby showed the limit of his emotion, this time
it being a chuckle that escaped him.</p>

<p>"Then good-bye and good luck. Beware lest you fall
in love with the charmer, my boy. Such a Lurline may
storm the ramparts of your flinty old heart, and once
lodged therein, heaven help you."</p>

<p>"Just so, sir. I am too old a bird to be caught with
chaff. I have been through the mill. Don't waste any
sympathy on Joel Darby, sir. But, there is an old acquaintance
of yours here."</p>

<p>"Ah! who may that be&mdash;male or female?" for his mind
instantly reverted to the girl from Porto Rico, and he
wondered if Darby could have run across her by chance.</p>

<p>"You once showed me a group picture of a very delightful
scene in a West Indian flower court, with the fountain
and bird cages. Besides yourself and a young Spanish
captain there were a charming girl and an old hidalgo
with a fierce beard and a mass of iron gray hair&mdash;a man
once seen never forgotten."</p>

<p>"Ah! Yes, General Porfidio de Brabant, the noblest Roman
of them all, whose voice is like the thunder burst of
his tropical home, and yet who obeys <em>her</em> slightest wish
as meekly as a lamb."</p>

<p>"Just so&mdash;sweet Porfidio is in Dublin."</p>

<p>"I am not surprised, since I have reason to believe she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
is here. In fact the woman disguised as a Sister of the
Holy Grail was Georgia, his niece, and the girl in the
picture."</p>

<p>Darby's thin lips gathered as though prepared to emit
a whistle, for like a flash he comprehended a very important
matter in connection with his employer; but his
will got the better of his inclination and not the faintest
sound followed.</p>

<p>"More than this, sir, I am afraid he has some connection
with these reckless schemers you have come here to
watch."</p>

<p>"It would not surprise me&mdash;the senor general is of
Spanish descent and doubtless loves the institutions of
Spain, so that with his generous and ardent nature he is
ready to risk all he has in order to help the wretched
mother country in her great hour of need. It does not
matter, since they will accomplish nothing here. These
Irish plotters are master masons in the art of promising
much and having some one else pull their chestnuts from
the fire. Still, it is our duty to know the many strings
perfidious Spain has to her bow."</p>

<p>"Just so, sir. I am going now."</p>

<p>"My blessing go with you, Darby. I shall anticipate
a rich and racy story when we twain meet again. Meanwhile,
again farewell."</p>

<p>When he stood alone Roderic heard a clock in a not
distant belfry chime the hour.</p>

<p>"Eleven&mdash;plenty of time for a man of his superior intelligence
to accomplish it all. By Jove! I would like to
see the result. I would wager he does it to the queen's
taste, and that with two Richmonds in the field Warwick
or Jerome or any other man would find it hard to tell the
genuine from the artificial. Reminds me of Shakespeare's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
two Dromios. Well, there's nothing for me to do
but take it quietly until morning, when I'll give my noble
duke a run for his money. Ye gods, I can imagine his
amazement. But he is not the man to let one failure
daunt him. I rather imagine we two may yet face each
other with sword or pistol in hand. That, gives me little
concern just now, however much it may later on. All
seems quiet around the hotel, so I presume the coast is
clear."</p>

<p>He found no difficulty in gaining his apartment unobserved,
and there proceeded to woo the gentle goddess
of sleep.</p>

<p>A methodical man, he was able to awaken at just the
hour he desired.</p>

<p>Perhaps a somewhat superficial knowledge of Wellington's
usual habits guided him in this matter quite as much
as his own desires.</p>

<p>An observation convinced him that the day had broken
fair and singularly cool, so that all nature appeared to rejoice.</p>

<p>He dressed with perhaps a little more care than ordinary
and stood before the glass arranging the ends of his four-in-hand.</p>

<p>"I wonder if her eyes still glow with their old intoxicating
light?" he muttered.</p>

<p>From which one might readily imagine the dreams
that had accompanied his slumber must have dealt more
or less with the owner of those heavenly orbs.</p>

<p>"And I kissed her hand again as of yore. Jove! how it
thrilled me. Did that kiss wipe out the past&mdash;is it possible
for us both to forgive and again be more than friends?
The very thought gives my heart hope. And yet what
a fool I am to forget&mdash;those magnificent rings&mdash;perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
one or more of them came from the bolero dancer, the
dashing Julio who took San Juan hearts by storm. Heaven
only knows&mdash;in my mad jealousy I accused her of encouraging
his attentions. Perhaps I was wrong, and again I
may have been right, for I never heard more of either
after I shook the red dust of San Juan from my feet. She
may have wedded him, and now be wife or widow. Ugh!
to the devil with such thoughts. Now to give dear old
Jerome a shake up he will never forget."</p>

<p>The idea afforded him some pleasure&mdash;at least it banished
that other hideous nightmare.</p>

<p>Wife or widow were the words he did not care to
hear used in connection with the owner of those magnificent
midnight orbs.</p>

<p>Jerome breakfasted at eight o'clock.</p>

<p>He was clockwork itself in regularity, no matter where
or under what conditions he spent the night, and when
Roderic glanced into the breakfast room there was his
victim busily engaged, his back to the door.</p>

<p>Jerome was something of a gourmand, and had a really
remarkable fondness for all the good things that tickle
the palate and appeal to a cultivated taste. He knew the
value of every wine on the list, and could distinguish
various brands of champagne with his eyes closed, for,
tell it not in Gath, Jerome had once upon a time been reduced
to making an honest livelihood as an expert wine
taster.</p>

<p>Owen sauntered into the almost deserted room, and
came up behind the dashing Adonis.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Wellington," he said briskly, as he
dropped into a chair just across from Jerome.</p>

<p>The latter started to make a civil reply, but when his
eyes fastened upon Roderic's face he turned as red as a
boiled lobster and spluttered out:</p>

<p>"Owen still here in Dublin by all the saints!"</p>

<div class="chapter">
<hr class="chap" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>
</div>

<h2 class="nobreak"><a name="Chapter_III" id="Chapter_III"></a>CHAPTER III.<br />

<small>AT DAGGERS' POINTS.</small></h2>


<p>It was Roderic's intention to lead the other a jolly little
dance before jumping upon him with both feet, so to
speak.</p>

<p>In other words he pleased to play with the conceited
beau pretty much as a cat might with a mouse that had
fallen into her clutches.</p>

<p>Hence he observed Jerome's amazed expression with
the air of a man who was puzzled.</p>

<p>"Still in Dublin&mdash;why not, my boy? This is about as
comfortable a berth as one could find, and I shall only
desert it when stern duty calls me across the big pond.
Whatever possessed you with the idea that I had departed
hence&mdash;why it was only late last night when I last saw
you?"</p>

<p>Wellington was making heroic efforts to resume his
ordinary cool appearance, but he had evidently been hard
hit, and fluttered like a wounded pigeon, which was a rare
thing with a man usually calm and sarcastic.</p>

<p>"By Jove! it must have been a bad dream, but, d'ye
know my dear fellow, I could swear you came and told me
you were off for Hamburg, Constantinople or&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Monte Carlo perhaps, since one place is about as
likely as the other."</p>

<p>"Well, er, perhaps it was. Wretched dream at any rate.
Must have been the Welsh rarebit I had about midnight&mdash;awful
fond of toast and cheese, you know, especially good
Roquefort. Glad to know it was only a dream, dused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
glad, my boy. Would have missed you very much&mdash;good
men are too scarce, as it is."</p>

<p>Thus Jerome babbled on, his object being simply delay,
in order to collect himself and grasp the situation.</p>

<p>At the same time possibly he hoped to pull the wool
over the eyes of the man he addressed.</p>

<p>It was useless.</p>

<p>When Roderic mentioned Monte Carlo the schemer
knew his game had been exposed through some blunder,
and all he could hope to fight for was advantage of position
when the assault came.</p>

<p>He therefore hurried up his reserves and proceeded to
call all hands to repel boarders.</p>

<p>Owen had folded his arms and was coolly surveying
him across the table&mdash;there was a curl to his mustached
lip that told of fine scorn.</p>

<p>Some men can stand almost anything rather than to
be made a mark for irony or disdain, and it was this
more than anything else that brought Wellington furiously
to the front.</p>

<p>"See here, Owen, all chicanery aside, how the devil
do you happen to be here at the Shelbourne instead of on
a yacht bound for Havre, and eventually to the gamester's
Paradise?" he blurted out.</p>

<p>"A plain question and deserving an equally candid answer.
To tell you the truth then, my dear fellow, I had
decided objections to making such a hasty trip across to
the Continent. Your preparations for my comfort were
overwhelming, and while I appreciated all you did I was
obliged to respectfully decline."</p>

<p>"Well, my own eyes tell me you are here, but I'll take
my oath I saw one who looked enough like you to be your
shadow sail out of Kingstown harbor at three this morning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
on board the steam yacht <em>Galatea</em>. And that was no
hasheesh dream either, superinduced by Welsh rarebit
or opium. Now, who the devil went to Havre?"</p>

<p>"A gentleman whose health needed the ocean voyage,
and who believed he could enjoy the society of the gay
set on board. I have no doubt he will be exceedingly
grateful for all your trouble."</p>

<p>Jerome looked at first as though he could bite a nail
with pleasure&mdash;Owen expected him to swear, but the other
seldom gave way to such vulgar exhibitions of temper.</p>

<p>On the contrary he smiled, and his white teeth showing
through his carefully adjusted mustache gave Roderic the
impression of a grinning hyena.</p>

<p>Still, the application hardly fitted such a case, for Jerome
was considered an extremely handsome and fascinating
man, however much of a human wolf he might be
back of the scenes.</p>

<p>"Owen, you have called the hand for the first round.
It is on me, and devilish hard. I could ill afford the cold
cash I spent to hire that boat. I sincerely trust your
counterpart will choke upon the good victuals I put aboard
or else make himself so beastly drunk upon the liquor
that he will fall overboard in the bay of Biscay or somewhere
along the French coast."</p>

<p>"Don't reproach me for doing just what you would
have done had you been in my shoes, and the plot been
revealed to you, Wellington."</p>

<p>The other brightened up a trifle.</p>

<p>"You may be sure I would&mdash;but evidently you received
a pretty strong tip&mdash;who betrayed me?"</p>

<p>He spoke carelessly, but there was a devilish gleam
in his blazing eyes that told the state of his feelings toward
the unknown.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>Owen would sooner have cut his right hand off than
betray the source of his knowledge.</p>

<p>"I have means of acquiring information that are unequalled
outside of Scotland Yard. For some time, Wellington,
I had looked upon you as an agreeable acquaintance.
That time has gone by. You have stripped the
mask from your face, and I know you as a wolf preying
upon society."</p>

<p>"Sir!"</p>

<p>"Oh! you needn't flare up and look ferocious. I say
this to your teeth. If you desire the satisfaction one gentleman
demands from another I am always at your service,
whether it be with bare knuckles, a revolver or the sword.
I believe I am equally at home with all, and will take great
pleasure in puncturing your precious skin."</p>

<p>"Well, you are devilish frank, to say the least," declared
Jerome, mastering his ugly mood, since he knew full well
the disadvantage falling to the man who gave way to passion.</p>

<p>"I expect to be, since it is the only policy to use when
dealing with such men as you. I might warn my cousin
against your attentions, but it would be useless, since
she has undoubtedly sized you up as an ordinary adventurer
long before I dreamed of it. However, my dear
fellow, one last word of warning before I quit your society.
If you take it upon yourself to <em>annoy</em> Cleo&mdash;if she
appeals to me for assistance I shall camp on your trail
until I finally '<em>get</em>' you, as they put it over in my country."</p>

<p>There was no boastful spirit in his manner, only a grim
determination that carried weight.</p>

<p>Wellington, looking squarely into those calm orbs that
held his own in a species of thralldom knew he had the
fight of his life before him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>Perhaps he saw with prophetic vision, some dim inkling
of his own downfall&mdash;it is a long road that has no
turn&mdash;success had visited him many times in the past, but
there was for him as for all adventurers, a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dies irae</i> and it
might come through Roderic Owen.</p>

<p>"I'll consider myself warned, Owen, and if trouble
comes my blood be upon my own head. The only remark
I shall venture to make is, that as yet I have never failed
in any serious undertaking which engaged my attention,"
he said, sneeringly.</p>

<p>"Indeed. Then let us hope you are not very serious
about this affair."</p>

<p>"I have made a vow. By that I mean to win, or fall.
Have you breakfasted, Owen?"</p>

<p>"Not yet. I shall order a chop and a cup of chocolate."</p>

<p>"You <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'wont'">won't</ins> join me then?"</p>

<p>"Well, under the circumstances, as we are to be mortal
enemies, I hardly think it would be wise. I have some of
the Arab's feeling about breaking bread or eating salt with
an enemy."</p>

<p>"I would give something to know who betrayed my
little game."</p>

<p>"Don't worry about it&mdash;my means are such that in order
to learn what I wish I am not compelled to make traitors
of those you trust."</p>

<p>"And the man on the yacht?"</p>

<p>"Oh! Darby is all right&mdash;you can depend upon it he
will enjoy himself to the limit. If you read of a man
breaking the bank at Monte Carlo presently, make up
your mind it was Darby, and that your noble generosity
is mainly responsible for his presence in that notable
place."</p>

<p>Jerome scowled and muttered something.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>"Perhaps it is as well you have decided to have your
breakfast in another quarter. Somehow you have the
knack of bruising me most savagely, and no doubt we
should be at each other's throat like a couple of dogs, ere
we finished. I wish to tell you distinctly that if you imagine
you can frighten me off by such heroics you are chasing
a mirage, a <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">fata morgana</i> as the deep sea sailors term
it. I am not that kind of a man, and you will find that
I sink or swim by my record."</p>

<p>Roderic did not care to bandy further words with the
Adonis.</p>

<p>Deeds must tell the story as to which of them should
win in the long run, and Owen preferred such a course.</p>

<p>It chanced that M'lle Cleo and her companion entered
the room about this time, and joining them Roderic had
his chop in merry company.</p>

<p>The daughter of ten millions looked fresh and full of
life. As he chatted with her across the table Owen was
wondering why she had never mated.</p>

<p>"It's the confounded dazzle of her money," he decided
finally; "she has educated herself to believe no one can
ever love <em>her</em>, but that the fortune draws them. By Jove!
She should hide herself under an <em>incog.</em> and thus discover
a lover who will worship her for her own dear self. I
warrant there are many good fellows who would gladly
go through fire and flood for her sake, if they knew her
only as a stenographer or schoolmam."</p>

<p>Which line of reasoning did Roderic credit.</p>

<p>That same fortune had something to do with his own
feelings in the matter, as it must with every honorable
man.</p>

<p>"When do you leave Dublin?" asked his cousin, endeavoring
to appear careless.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>"I shall cross to Liverpool to-morrow and take the
White Star steamer for New York&mdash;unless something
occurs to change my plans."</p>

<p>"Then you are compelled to go to New York?"</p>

<p>"Only as a means of reaching my ultimate destination."</p>

<p>"Which is&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He lowered his voice.</p>

<p>"Porto Rico."</p>

<p>"But, the danger&mdash;that is a Spanish stronghold, and we
are at war with Spain."</p>

<p>"Already troops are ordered to land there&mdash;perhaps
General Miles is on the way. With the fall of Santiago
our efforts are to be concentrated about San Juan. A
portion of the work falls upon my shoulders&mdash;that is all.
Besides, I naturally want to be in at the death, as do all
ardent fox hunters in the chase."</p>

<p>"I wish, cousin, you would give up so dangerous a calling.
Surely you are as well fitted for other pursuits in
which your life would not be at stake."</p>

<p>There was real concern in her voice, and Roderic found
his heart touched.</p>

<p>"I have been seriously considering that same matter
myself, and concluded to make a change after the war is
over."</p>

<p>"Why wait until then?"</p>

<p>"For many reasons. In the first place Western men
have a saying that it is bad policy to change horses while
crossing a stream. It is also a poor piece of business to
desert your country while she has need of your services."</p>

<p>"Enough. I know that your motives are honorable.
But about this trip across to the Antilles&mdash;I could tell you
of a quicker way of reaching the shore of Porto Rico,
that is, should you consider it worth your while to accept,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
with a tinge of color in her cheeks, and a sparkle to her
blue eyes.</p>

<p>"Indeed, I should like to hear of it. Time may be a
factor in my game."</p>

<p>"I made a purchase in England&mdash;you know I am something
of a yachtsman in my way, and the temptation was
great."</p>

<p>"You purchased a yacht?"</p>

<p>"A steam yacht."</p>

<p>"Lucky mortal to be able to do such a thing with as
little concern as I would buy a cravat."</p>

<p>"She is a beauty, Roderic."</p>

<p>"Don't doubt it in the least, else you would never have
fancied her."</p>

<p>"She is called the Dreadnaught."</p>

<p>"Phew! a genuine English name. Of course you will
change it to the Mayflower or Pilgrim or some strictly
Yankee cognomen?"</p>

<p>"At present I must decline to do so, as she sails with an
English crew and under the flag of Great Britain."</p>

<p>Owen looked puzzled, and then smiled.</p>

<p>"Oh! I see, a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ruse de guerre</i>. Very good, indeed. The
Dreadnaught she shall remain as long as our war with
Spain continues. Well, are you off for a delightful voyage
along the Mediterranean, or perhaps, seeing it is summer,
to the North Cape, the Land of the Midnight Sun.
Jove! at another time I might be tempted to join you&mdash;that
is providing I were invited."</p>

<p>"I extend a most pressing invitation and expect you to
accept and be our <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">compagnon de voyage</i>."</p>

<p>"Alas! my duty lies amid sterner scenes."</p>

<p>"In ten days you can be landed on the shore of Porto
Rico."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>He eyed her in surprise.</p>

<p>"Is your voyage a westerly one?"</p>

<p>"We are intending to see something of the war, that
is all."</p>

<p>Perhaps uncertain but nevertheless alarming visions
were conjured up in his mind.</p>

<p>"I am sorry to hear you say so. The conditions existing
on those unhappy islands are terrible. Besides, an
attractive woman would run risks among the lawless elements
at large that I should grieve to see you exposed to."</p>

<p>She laughed, but at the same time his solicitude did not
appear unwelcome in the least.</p>

<p>"Foolish boy, you don't suppose, I hope, that I have any
Quixotic notion of parading across the island carrying the
star spangled banner wrapped around me. My object is
of a different character. For once in my life I am to play
the Lady Bountiful. Cuba has been looked after as well
as the conditions allow. I am informed there is also much
suffering in Porto Rico. I have had my yacht stocked
with provisions and medical stores, and shall relieve honest
distress wherever I find it, no matter under what
flag."</p>

<p>"God bless you, Cousin Cleo. You will find plenty of
it there. The Spaniards have tightened the mailed hand
of late, and Porto Rico groans under the scourge. Soon
freedom's blessings will be their heritage. Every man
whose smallest act brings such a consummation to pass,
should feel proud of the fact. Where is this boat of yours,
cousin?"</p>

<p>"Entering Dublin bay this morning."</p>

<p>"And when will you leave old Erin?"</p>

<p>"When you give the word."</p>

<p>It confused him a little to realize how much she deferred
to his judgment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>"Pardon me&mdash;will there be other passengers?"</p>

<p>"None."</p>

<p>"Then I will accept"&mdash;he had desired to make sure Jerome's
hateful presence might not bring about a duel during
the voyage.</p>

<p>"We will call it settled. An hour's notice will find
us aboard, bag and baggage. Govern your own actions as
your duty demands."</p>

<p>"This is awfully kind of you Cousin Cleo."</p>

<p>"The obligation is on your part, to put up with our dull
society for ten days."</p>

<p>"You hurt me when you speak that way. It will surely
be one of the most pleasant episodes of my life. I am
smiling to think that after most positively declining one
yacht voyage last night I have so readily accepted another."</p>

<p>"Some one else asked you to go to Porto Rico?"</p>

<p>"Well, no, I rather imagine the intention was for me
to bring up in a hotter country than the Antilles. The
trip contemplated a voyage to Havre and then across
country to the later Monaco, the gambling palace of
Monte Carlo."</p>

<p>"Oh! I am glad you refused to go."</p>

<p>"So am I. But the invitation was very pressing.
However, rather than disappoint the gentleman I sent my
representative to receive the honors."</p>

<p>"It was a <em>gentleman</em> who asked you then?"</p>

<p>His eyes opened with surprise.</p>

<p>"Certainly&mdash;that is he did not really ask me, you see,
but arranged a neat little affair whereby I was to be a
guest of honor."</p>

<p>"How stupid of me, to be sure, I begin to see now that
you are speaking of a business engagement, not a social<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
matter. And will your substitute serve as well as if you
had gone?"</p>

<p>"Just as well, until they learn that it is not Roderic
Owen they are entertaining with so lavish a hand, but
plain Joel Darby. Then I imagine there will be an explosion
of some sort and her ladyship will show temper."</p>

<p>"Her ladyship&mdash;then there is a woman involved?"</p>

<p>"It is true. I see, cousin, that having put my foot in
it thus far I would do well to tell you the whole story."</p>

<p>"I should be pleased to act as Father Confessor," was
the quick response.</p>

<p>They were alone at the table, Miss Becky having gone
across the room to chat with a congenial spirit whose acquaintance
she had made.</p>

<p>So Roderic told his little story as tersely as he could,
and in his cousin he found an interested auditor.</p>

<p>"Well, what do you think of it?" he asked when the
finis had been reached.</p>

<p>"It is very dreadful."</p>

<p>"Surely I came out all right, cousin."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;suppose you had not&mdash;you would have been
hypnotized by the adventuress, and that must have been
the end of you. Oh! I know the species and all their
wiles, having made a study of them."</p>

<p>"Does that sweeping deduction include the male bipeds
of the adventurer order also?"</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Because I might offend if I told you the name of the
man who planned my exodus."</p>

<p>"Oh! I have already guessed it was the Adonis."</p>

<p>"Yes, Jerome Wellington. I am glad you know him
in his true light. He has made a vow."</p>

<p>"I'll wager it concerns my wretched millions."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>"Just so&mdash;he longs to handle them."</p>

<p>"He will be a smarter man than he is now when that
happens. But one thing puzzles me?"</p>

<p>"Now it is coming," thought Roderic, though aloud he
said cheerily, "What might that be?"</p>

<p>"You received your warning from a nun."</p>

<p>"I was a fool to mention the fact," thought Owen, with
one of these wonderful after inspirations that closes the
door when the horse is stolen.</p>

<p>"Yes, from one who was dressed in the somber garb of
a cloister," he replied.</p>

<p>"You evidently do not believe she was what she outwardly
appeared?"</p>

<p>"You are a modern Portia, cousin," he laughed.</p>

<p>"Of course, a prisoner at the bar is not pledged to commit
himself. If I am over bold forgive me and make no
reply. But, you know, a woman's curiosity is proverbial."</p>

<p>"I shall answer frankly&mdash;she was no member of the
Order of the Holy Grail&mdash;the garb was assumed to conceal
her identity."</p>

<p>"From Jerome&mdash;from you?"</p>

<p>"Both, I presume."</p>

<p>"You recognized her face?"</p>

<p>"I did not see that&mdash;it was her voice. Even then I
was in a maze until she had gone."</p>

<p>"Was it a <em>very</em> melodious voice, Roderic."</p>

<p>"The sweetest&mdash;well, yes, a voice full of melody," he replied,
with evident confusion that did not escape Cleo's
quick gaze.</p>

<p>"Ah! you have heard her sing?"</p>

<p>"Dozens of times&mdash;like a nightingale," he felt forced
to confess.</p>

<p>"This was&mdash;where?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>"In San Juan, Porto Rico, two years back. I have not
looked on her face since I fled those shores."</p>

<p>"Ah!" and that one word expressed keen disappointment,
for Cleo read the story of his lost love in his face.</p>

<small>MILLIONS MAY NOT PURCHASE LOVE.</small></h2>


<p>"Would it be presumptuous if I asked to know her
name, Roderic&mdash;this girl of San Juan who risked so much
to save your reputation if not your life? I feel under obligations
to her, for your name is very dear to those who
know you&mdash;those bound to you by ties of consanguinity."</p>

<p>"She comes of Spanish descent, but her heart is now
only wrapped up in the future of the lovely gem of the
Antilles. Her name is Georgia Inez de Brabant."</p>

<p>Perhaps his manner gave evidence that she was treading
on dangerous ground.</p>

<p>"Thank you. Perhaps some day fortune may bring us
together. I shall try to love her, Roderic, because you
call her your <em>friend!</em>"</p>

<p>Then she branched off upon the subject of the cruise,
to which she seemed to look forward with almost childish
delight.</p>

<p>It is not every one to whom is given the proud fortune
to own a modern steam yacht, and this daughter of Eve
could be forgiven a fair amount of exhilaration under the
circumstances.</p>

<p>Perhaps, truth to tell, the prospect of ten days basking
in the company of her athletic cousin had something to
do with her light spirits.</p>

<p>Owen's time was not wholly his own, so that he was
soon forced to sally forth upon the streets of the Irish
metropolis.</p>

<p>When Cleo was alone she hastened to her luxurious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
apartments and searching the inmost recesses of an inlaid
traveling writing desk which had been taken from
a capacious trunk, she soon pounced upon a small photograph.</p>

<p>It was wretchedly done by a tyro in Ponce, but even
boorish work could not entirely conceal the fact that the
face was that of a most lovely dark-eyed houri.</p>

<p>Cleo looked eagerly at it.</p>

<p>"I have had this now two years. Roderic dropped it
in the garden, and I hid it away for a joke and then forgot
to speak of it. This is the picture of a daughter of Porto
Rico&mdash;is it the same who is now in Dublin, who last night
at the peril of her name warned him of evil? I have
reason to believe such to be the truth, for unless I am
greatly mistaken I saw this same beauty coming out of
St. Patrick's cathedral yesterday morning, when a gust
of wind blew her veil aside. In this land where Irish
gray or blue eyes abound I was immediately attracted by
such a beautiful pair of melting dusky orbs.</p>

<p>"Heigho! this is Roderic's fate no doubt. Heaven
grant that he may be happy whate'er betide, for he deserves
it. I would give all my miserable millions for his
heart's love, but it can not be. There is a startling story
of the past connected with this girl, I am sure. Why did
they separate&mdash;does she love him still? Well, perhaps
the future may tell."</p>

<p>She put the photograph slowly back in the lodging
place where it had so long rested securely. Even great
riches had not the power to bring this young woman
unalloyed happiness, for the one treasure she would have
valued above all other earthly possessions seemed denied
her by a cruel fate.</p>

<p>It were hardly fair that all the joys of earth were handed
over to the disposal of one mortal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>While she rolled in wealth beyond Aladdin's dreams
and sighed for true love, many who were blessed in this
regard struggled for a daily pittance and groaned because
their heart's devotion could not come between the
object of their worship and cruel Want.</p>

<p>Truly, this is a queer old world, and at times it seems
unequally divided; but occasionally there is a shaking up
all around that evens things up somewhat.</p>

<p>Possessed of a sudden notion Cleo dressed for the
street.</p>

<p>When she went out it was with a laughing remark to
Miss Becky, whom she intercepted upon the broad carpeted
main stairway, to the effect that a number of little
shopping duties had to be looked after.</p>

<p>However, M'lle Cleo's ideas of the shopping district
must have become a little mixed, for she sauntered in the
direction of that quaint mass of stone and glass with its
spire and numerous minarets known as St. Patrick's
Cathedral.</p>

<p>She looked through the iron fence at the flat slabs and
few monuments commemorating illustrious Irish dead,
she studied the architecture of the historic building, and
cast many a curious glance at those who passed in to late
mass or came out from the interior.</p>

<p>Her object seemed doomed to disappointment, for the
face she sought was not seen.</p>

<p>Once she eyed a lady closely veiled, who came out in
company with a military looking gentleman sporting a
shaggy head of gray hair <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">&agrave; la</i> Mark Twain, also a ferocious
mustache waxed at the ends and giving the wearer
the fierce appearance of King Humbert.</p>

<p>As the couple passed Cleo she chanced to hear the lady
make a casual remark, and two things struck the listener
as singular.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>First it was pure Spanish she heard.</p>

<p>Second, her voice was so very melodious it seemed to
conjure up visions of rippling water, warbling birds and
all those things of which poets love to rave.</p>

<p>Cleo remembered&mdash;could she ever forget the pain that
shot through her heart at the time&mdash;how Roderic had
grown suddenly enthusiastic when he declared the voice
of Senorita de Brabant as musical as the notes of a nightingale&mdash;she
had doubtless sung for him many times those
passionate serenades and love songs for which dark eyed
daughters of old Spain have ever been famous.</p>

<p>Cleo could imagine how those wonderful black orbs
glowed with love's sacred fire when <em>he</em> sat near, upon a
soft divan, or bent over the gurgling fountain's basin.</p>

<p>She felt sick at heart, but such a nature never reveals
the pain that rankles within.</p>

<p>Though suffering tortures such girls will laugh and
seem as merry as the lightest hearted among their comrades.</p>

<p>After that came the shopping, and yet Cleo was annoyed
to find herself listening to every voice upon the
street and in the stores.</p>

<p>Surely there could not be another in all Dublin that so
fully filled the brief but graphic description Roderic had
given of a woman's tones sounding like the soft gurgling
of water over the mossy stones in the primeval forest.</p>

<p>"I wonder under what conditions we will meet, for
something tells me this is bound to occur. And shall I
too be drawn to her because he has given his heart? Will
she love him&mdash;love my old play fellow Roderic as&mdash;as I
could do, have done these many years? Perhaps, but I
doubt it, doubt whether these hot blooded girls of the
tropic isles can love so truly that they will sacrifice even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
their own happiness in order that <em>his</em> life may be filled
with sunshine. Still, God forgive me for judging her
harshly. I have other things&mdash;his love may be all in all
to her. Come what will I shall do what is right and loyal
and true as becomes a daughter of Virginia. But oh!
it is hard to give him up, my hope, my boy lover, my
Roderic. Now I am done!"</p>

<p>Having thus grimly dismissed the matter from her
mind for the present the young lady proceeded to carry
out her designs.</p>

<p>Numerous things were on her list to be added to the
abundant stores aboard the yacht, and it would probably
puzzle the honest steward, she imagined, to know what
to do with the last arrivals.</p>

<p>"If I remained in Dublin three days more I am sure we
would be swamped in the bay made celebrated by song
and story, or else be compelled to charter a companion
boat to share our cargo&mdash;there are so many things I see
that could be made useful among the wretched people
just escaping from Spanish rule, and these Irish storekeepers
one and all, must have had an intimate acquaintance
with the Blarney stone, they have such engaging
ways and a burning desire to accumulate Uncle Sam's
coin. This is an era of good feeling&mdash;of hands across
the sea&mdash;Brother John and Brother Jonathan, and they
all want to be in it as deep as possible. However, I think
I am actually done. It would be impossible to accept all
they offer."</p>

<p>So the purchasing agency went reluctantly out of commission.</p>

<p>Even the owner of millions must draw the line somewhere.</p>

<p>Roderic was not to be seen at luncheon, although Cleo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
purposely lingered over the meal, hoping he would turn
up.</p>

<p>Jerome was there, handsome as ever, and apparently
much sought after by a designing lady mother from Chicago
who possessed two plain girls of a marriageable age.</p>

<p>No doubt they believed him a marquis, or at the very
least connected with some noble family anxious to make
a "connection" with pork.</p>

<p>These things happen frequently, and there really seems
no remedy&mdash;the market is there and the goods offered
for sale. Occasionally a genuine love match occurs which
redounds to the credit of Old England and Young America;
but for the most part they are cut and dried affairs
entered into for position on one side and gold on the other.
Such unions are beneath contempt.</p>

<p>Jerome bowed and smiled in his usual affable manner,
and Cleo answered him just as though she had not been
informed of his dark schemes.</p>

<p>This matter of fact young woman had traveled far and
wide&mdash;she had rubbed up against all manner of people,
and long since ceased to be excessively surprised at anything.</p>

<p>Wellington was simply carrying out the business for
which nature had endowed him.</p>

<p>There were many people gifted with more money than
brains&mdash;the reverse was true in his case, and he amused
himself by endeavoring to bring about a more evenly balanced
condition of affairs, to his pecuniary advantage, of
course.</p>

<p>Cleo could even find something to admire about his
bold piratical way of living by his wits&mdash;at least he had
more of the man about him than most of the petted darlings
of society on both sides of the Atlantic who fawned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
upon her in a sickly sentimental way from precisely the
same sinister motives that influenced Wellington's bold
attacks.</p>

<p>Let these parvenu mammas with daughters to sell pay
the penalty for their sin.</p>

<p>As the day wore on and she saw nothing of Roderic
she began to feel a little worried.</p>

<p>Could harm have befallen him?</p>

<p>She knew the unscrupulous character of those elements
which he usually pitted his powers against.</p>

<p>Perhaps Wellington, that suave deluder, not one whit
discouraged by his first failure, had promptly opened
his secondary batteries.</p>

<p>Still, it seemed almost ridiculous to believe harm could
have befallen a sensible man like Roderic in the open
streets of Dublin while the sun was shining.</p>

<p>Had it been Algiers, Constantinople, Pekin or some
city of mysterious India, the case would have appeared
far more serious, for uncanny things are liable to occur
in such Oriental marts at any hour of the day or night.</p>

<p>As evening drew on apace she found herself watching
the doorway beyond which lay the calm square known
as St. Stephens' Green.</p>

<p>Her captain had come ashore for a comparison of
ideas, and was still with her, since Cleo desired him to
meet her cousin.</p>

<p>They would see much of each other during the voyage,
and she particularly desired to bring about the meeting
of two congenial souls.</p>

<p>Dinner passed.</p>

<p>Still no Roderic.</p>

<p>She confided her fears in part to the captain.</p>

<p>The worthy seadog was able to wrestle with any perplexing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
problem that might assail them afloat, but when
it came to mastering the wiles apt to beset a man's path
ashore he confessed his ignorance.</p>

<p>Nothing could be done&mdash;they must wait till a sign of
some kind was given.</p>

<p>That was the exasperating part, for Cleo was naturally
a girl of decided action.</p>

<p>An hour crept by since dinner&mdash;two of them, and it was
now drawing near ten o'clock.</p>

<p>No one entered the door but that Cleo's eyes were instantly
upon them, and disappointment had as yet been
the only result.</p>

<p>She endeavored to be her own lively self but it required
a great effort.</p>

<p>Roderic might be in danger, but somehow she was possessed
of the idea that it was more from a pair of midnight
eyes than a murderous stiletto, for Cleo could not
forget the face she had seen, the lovely original of her
photograph, who was even now in Dublin.</p>

<p>Was her power of enchantment over Roderic still unbroken&mdash;could
she draw him to her even after an absence
of two years&mdash;had the bar that separated them been cast
aside?</p>

<p>How these questions flashed before her eyes and seemed
burned upon her brain like coals of fire. She suffered intensely,
but the bluff old sea dog never knew it&mdash;indeed
he believed her to be unusually brilliant, her wit was so
keen and her suggestions as to their coming voyage so
remarkably clever.</p>

<p>She dreaded the thought of having to retire in this
state of uncertainty.</p>

<p>The hour drew on&mdash;it neared eleven, and the ladies had
wholly disappeared.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>Then Cleo suddenly gave a sigh of relief, for her eager
eyes had discovered his well known figure entering the
front door of the hotel.</p>

<p>She noted instantly that he looked disturbed, and that
his usually natty appearance was lacking&mdash;and practical
Cleo knew Roderic had been through an adventure. Half
rising as she beckoned to him, she awaited his coming
with breathless impatience.</p>

<small>RODERIC'S REPENTANCE.</small></h2>


<p>Roderic had indeed been up against it good and hard
since leaving his cousin at the breakfast table.</p>

<p>He had entered upon his duties of the day with a vim,
desirous of closing his accounts so that he might get away
on the next morning, if Cleo and her captain were willing.</p>

<p>During the morning he was haunted by certain facts
which bore heavily upon the relations existing between
present conditions and those that prevailed two years
back.</p>

<p>The girl from Porto Rico occupied a prime place in all
these reflections.</p>

<p>Every word that had been spoken by her on the preceding
night came again before his mental vision, and
underwent a revised scrutiny.</p>

<p>New solutions sprang up, for he was able to better understand
certain things that were uttered.</p>

<p>Still there was much to puzzle him.</p>

<p>How came she to know of Cleo, his cousin&mdash;true, in
times past, when paradise seemed opening to his feet&mdash;ah,
what a fool's dream he had indulged in&mdash;he must have
frequently spoken of his cousin, for she was often in his
mind; but that would not account for her pertinent remarks
concerning Cleo's attachment for him.</p>

<p>Was it jealousy prompted this?</p>

<p>Roderic flushed with pleasure at the very thought of
such a thing, since the green-eyed monster can never
lodge in a human heart unless there still remains love to
stir the depths.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>Then, somehow, he felt a strange shudder pass through
his whole frame.</p>

<p>Would it bring trouble of any kind to this loyal cousin,
whose welfare was certainly as dear to him as that of a
sister?</p>

<p>He knew much of these southern women&mdash;their virtues
and frailties&mdash;and realized what a serious thing it meant
to be passionately loved by one of them, and how ill they
brooked rivalry.</p>

<p>The love Georgia had given him was so entirely different
from the pure, unselfish devotion of which Cleo was
capable&mdash;he knew this as well as any one, and yet with
his eyes open he had chosen the rush of the hurricane to
the calm, steady current of never changing regard.</p>

<p>Love is a little god who will have his way despite reason
and philosophy.</p>

<p>Once poor mortal falls under his sway and farewell to
discernment&mdash;from that time on Cupid sits in the balance,
and weighs things to suit his own capricious nature.</p>

<p>Thus our good Roderic found himself worried with a
variety of new questions, such as it had not occurred to
him before could ever come up in connection with his
affairs.</p>

<p>They cropped up before him in his business and he
found it utterly impossible to get rid of them. What was
on the heart must have a place in the mind in spite of stern
endeavors to banish his own private affairs from the front.</p>

<p>Thus the day wore on.</p>

<p>Things worked fairly well.</p>

<p>He sent some letters, and toward the close of the afternoon
some telegrams in cipher intended for those connected
with the government at Washington in whose
special line he was working.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>Finally he pronounced his work done.</p>

<p>Unless some late orders, which he did not look for,
turned up to intercept him, he was free to shake the dust
of old Erin from his shoes on the morrow.</p>

<p>He anticipated the voyage to the West Indies with considerable
pleasure, for, as the veil of the future can not be
raised by mortal hands, how was he to know what strange
happenings might occur before the anchor was lifted, to
change his relations to the owner of the yacht?</p>

<p>About sundown he visited a store on Lower Sackville
street where he had been receiving his mail.</p>

<p>There was a message awaiting him.</p>

<p>It came from Darby.</p>

<p>How that remarkable man had managed to mail the
letter was a puzzle to Roderic, but no doubt he had prepared
the envelope with a stamp and found some means
of getting it posted by bribing a sailor.</p>

<p>Darby could accomplish anything under heaven when
he made up his mind.</p>

<p>The note was brief and epigrammatic, just as Darby's
speech had always been. Time was worth money to him,
and he used very few words.</p>

<p>"They got me as per agreement. We are on the way to
Havre. Will touch at coast of Cornwall for private reasons
of captain. Mail this there if possible. The French
m'amselle aboard. Charming young woman. Think I
shall be pleasantly entertained, as she has a voice like a
bird. Do not pity me, comrade. I may go all the way
to Monte Carlo. Who could refuse such good fortune?
More anon."</p>

<p>That was all.</p>

<p>Roderic laughed when he read it.</p>

<p>"What a sly dog that Darby is&mdash;outwardly an iceberg, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
glacier, he yet possesses the capacity for adoring lovely
woman. Perhaps he may yet be wrecked upon the same
reefs that have been the destruction of so many. Alas! poor
Yorick. But I am willing to wager that at least he extracts
some fun out of this game before he gives up the
ghost."</p>

<p>And now, dinner!</p>

<p>The thought was delightful, since his appetite had become
clamorous, and besides there was great pleasure in
the anticipation of some hours in the society of his cousin.
Cleo could chat so entertainingly of many things he had
seen, for both were great travelers.</p>

<p>She had visited the frequented thoroughfares of ordinary
travel. Besides, she had gone from Europe to India
via the overland Afghanistan and Khyber Pass route, had
looked upon the celebrated Vale of Cashmere, wandered
in Cathay, and was at home in Japan.</p>

<p>It can be readily understood how much satisfaction
Roderic found in chatting with her on these subjects, for
the fever of exploration was growing upon him all the
while&mdash;he yearned to delve amid the wild places of earth
seldom or never gazed upon by the eyes of civilization&mdash;he
had already ridden on elephants in Siam, mounted the Peruvian
Andes on a llama, explored the Himalayas with
adventurous officers, their only vehicle being drawn by
yaks; and once Roderic had scoured the desolate Kirghiz
steppes on a tarantas drawn by shuffling camels.</p>

<p>Secretly he aspired to some day make his way to the
Forbidden City of Tibet, where the foot of a white man
has never yet trodden, and whose gorgeous wonders yet
remain sealed books to the world&mdash;a city which the bold
traveler Harry Savage Landor recently endeavored to
reach but was forced to abandon the task as impossible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>At present of course these things were hung up in abeyance,
since his beloved country was at war with Spain,
and called upon her patriotic sons to overwhelm the enemy,
both in the field and under the guise of diplomacy.</p>

<p>The pursuit of his business had taken him far out from
the central part of the city and the river Liffey.</p>

<p>From Donnybrook he had crossed to the region of Rathmines,
where in an interview with one whose word carried
great weight among the Fenian brotherhood, he learned
that the mission of the Spanish schemers had failed.</p>

<p>This was a matter of great importance to those faithful
statesmen at Washington who labored to prevent any combination
of European Powers against Young America&mdash;it
meant that the great coalition would pull through and
that poor Spain must take her drubbing.</p>

<p>He had mounted to the upper deck of a tramcar and
was on the way back to the city, surveying with considerable
interest the names of the many villas, places and terraces,
for every householder apparently desired to mark
his residence by some appropriate designation.</p>

<p>From this state of beatitude, superinduced by the clear
consciousness of a day's work well done and the soothing
effect of a good pipe, Roderic was without the least warning
precipitated into a condition of tremendous excitement.</p>

<p>He had just noted the old name on a rough stone gate
post "Lucknow Bungalow," and was wondering if some
gallant retired officer who had seen exciting days with
Havelock, or later with gallant Roberts, might live in cozy
retirement here, surrounded by objects brought from the
far distant realm of Her Majesty the Empress of India,
when some magnetism seemed to draw his gaze toward
the romantic house set back a little from the road.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>Just at the same instant some one leaned out of an
open window as if to close a shutter, some one whose personality
acted upon Roderic very much as might a shock
of electricity.</p>

<p>Of course it was the girl from Porto Rico.</p>

<p>That she saw him and recognized him Roderic realized
instantly.</p>

<p>It was another freak of Fate.</p>

<p>When the three sisters who weave our destinies with
distaff and loom, conspire against a poor mortal, there is
little use trying to dodge the snare, since the loop falls
over one's shoulders on the most unexpected occasions,
and usually without warning.</p>

<p>Roderic yielded, rescue or no rescue, at once.</p>

<p>He immediately arose from his place and made down
the winding stairs at the end of the car. The vehicle had
been progressing meanwhile as rapidly as two sturdy Irish
horses could draw it along the rails, and by the time the
gentleman from across the Atlantic reached <em>terra firma</em>
they were half a block away from the bungalow and its
stone posts.</p>

<p>Roderic had not developed any plan of action&mdash;what
he did was from sheer impulse.</p>

<p>The sight of her face had spurred him on&mdash;nor might
this be set down as the only instance where a woman's
lovely countenance caused unpremeditated action on the
part of a usually conservative and well balanced man.</p>

<p>When he reached the distinguishing stone pillars upon
which he read the name of the villa, Roderic boldly turned
in.</p>

<p>Prudence might have dictated another course, for there
was reason to believe, as both Darby and himself had discovered,
that the old Porto Rican general, Georgia's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
uncle in fact, was allied with those who had endeavored
to work the grand scheme.</p>

<p>Therefore, he would not be apt to look upon any Yankee,
and particularly Roderic Owen, with favor.</p>

<p>General Porfidio to the contrary, the American strode
past the sentinel posts, up the box bordered walk and directly
to the front door.</p>

<p>This was his nature, bold to a fault, ready to walk directly
up to the cannon's mouth if duty but half demanded
it.</p>

<p>It was the Irish element in his blood, for where that
strain goes throughout the peoples of the wide world, it
carries with it devotion and gallantry.</p>

<p>Before he could lay a hand upon the knocker, that represented
a bronze Hindoo god, the door softly opened.</p>

<p>A young girl stood there.</p>

<p>As he looked at her, framed in the opening, with the
light of the setting sun falling upon her wondrous face,
Roderic held his very breath, for he was again under the
spell of her dusky eyes, that ever wove a web of enchantment
about him.</p>

<p>Thus they stood, these two who had parted some years
before&mdash;stood and stared and said not a single word for
more than a full minute.</p>

<p>What they lived over in those sixty seconds of time
God only knows.</p>

<p>Perhaps there came up before them a vision of Paradise
Lost&mdash;of sweet scented flowers, flashing fountains, caroling
birds&mdash;of a West Indian garden where the God of
Love reigned, where the soft tinkle of magic mandolin
accompanied songs of hottest devotion, where eyes looked
into eyes and drank to the fill of heaven's nectar, where
vows of constancy were fervently breathed and returned.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
Alas! how many times these same maddening memories
arise to haunt broken hearts, for human nature is weak,
and prone to wander afar after strange idols.</p>

<p>Roderic recovered his voice, and while he still kept his
eyes on her glowing face he said, quietly:</p>

<p>"You expected me&mdash;you knew I would come?"</p>

<p>"I believed you would when I saw you look this way,"
she admitted; and then added: "but I do not know why
you are here, Senor Roderic."</p>

<p>"Perhaps to thank you."</p>

<p>"For what?" confused.</p>

<p>"Your garb deceived me last night, but I knew the voice
which you could not wholly disguise. I wish to tell you
how&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stop. I do not desire to hear your gratitude. It was
a duty with me. By chance I learned of the miserable
plot. I could not bear to even see an enemy so badly
used, much less one whom I once delighted to call&mdash;my
friend."</p>

<p>"Once&mdash;are we then no longer such?"</p>

<p>"Senor, your welfare will always be regarded with interest
by me," coldly.</p>

<p>"You have condemned me unheard," with a gesture of
despair.</p>

<p>"Not I, senor, but yourself. The choice lay before you,
and you decided to flee from San Juan&mdash;from Elysium.
You were unjust&mdash;for once in your life. You alone,
senor, condemned, not I."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;was there no reason&mdash;I beg of you, I implore,
an answer?"</p>

<p>"Senor, this is a house where danger lurks for you&mdash;a
house where plots are nightly considered against your
people. It would be better for you to go away lest some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
of these hot headed Spanish sympathizers set eyes on
you."</p>

<p>"Let them go to the devil&mdash;what care I for all the Spaniards
in Christendom. I shall stay here just as long as I
like&mdash;as long as you allow me."</p>

<p>"Ah! senor, but you did not always exhibit that same
spirit&mdash;there was <em>one</em> Spaniard you feared worse than
Satan does holy water."</p>

<p>The spirit of coquetry ever lives in woman, and this
girl could not resist giving poor Owen a little thrust even
while her heart was wonderfully stirred by his presence.</p>

<p>"Yes, Julio, the handsome bolero dancer, who had once
been a famous toreador in Spain. As I hope for salvation
I believe you favored his advances&mdash;you laughed at me
when a denial was what I asked. Words followed, for
my part in which may Heaven forgive me, and we parted
in hot anger, we two who had been all in all to each other.
Georgia, will you answer that question <em>now?</em>" he asked,
holding her eyes enthralled by his eager gaze.</p>

<p>She did not speak, only put out her hand and plucked
him by the sleeve.</p>

<p>It was only a gentle pull, but to Roderic Owen the
power of a giant steam engine could not exert greater
force.</p>

<p>She meant that he should enter that East Indian bower&mdash;she
would answer his passionate question&mdash;the doubts
and fears that had haunted him lo, these many moons
were on the eve of being forever put to rest.</p>

<p>Thus he followed her through the doorway and presently
found himself in a little parlor where walls and mantles
were almost covered with hundreds of strange mementoes
of the land of Buddha and Vishnu&mdash;grinning
idols, miniature elephants, tiger skins, queer swords and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
knives, and wonderful pieces of colored work fashioned
by the cunning handicraft of those natives of Bengal and
Ceylon.</p>

<p>Upon the floor were strewn very costly rugs from
Dagestan and Persia.</p>

<p>There was an air of romance hovering about the apartment&mdash;even
the peculiar Oriental odor that was so pronounced,
seemed to be associated with tender scenes.</p>

<p>Roderic felt it, and a strange eagerness took possession
of his heart.</p>

<p>Was such happiness as he had never allowed himself
to dream could dawn upon him again about to become
his guest?</p>

<p>Having led him into this apartment, the girl drew back
the Bagdad curtains in order that more light from the
westerly sun might enter, after which she advanced slowly
toward him.</p>

<p>Her head was lowered, so that he knew not whether
those wonderful orbs were filled with love or contempt,
and the uncertainty alarmed him.</p>

<p>"You have surely not brought me in here to upbraid,
Georgia&mdash;I cannot believe that. It would have been
enough had you desired me to go, to have told me so outside,
and while ready to ask forgiveness on my knees, if
you assured me I was quite in the wrong, I would have
turned away without one reproach, deserving all. I asked
you the question that has burned itself upon my brain
ever since that hour when I flung myself out of your presence
so madly, and vowed never again to believe in a
woman's love. Was dashing Julio anything to you <em>then</em>&mdash;is
he <em>now?</em>"</p>

<p>Then she threw back her proud head and looked him
in the face&mdash;he was answered even before she spoke a
word.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>"One finger of your hand, Roderic Owen, yes, even its
tip was of more value to me in those days than a dozen
bolero dancers with their graceful movements and threadbare
love phrases. Julio sued in vain&mdash;I laughed him to
scorn&mdash;I have not seen him from the hour you fled."</p>

<p>Then a glad cry burst from his lips&mdash;he opened his
arms and would have seized upon her, believing that she
had forgiven&mdash;that the old conditions could be thus easily
revived, since the barrier that had separated them was
swept aside.</p>

<p>He had lowered his pride&mdash;he had humbly cried
"<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">peccavi</i>&mdash;I have sinned," and it was reasonable to believe
that if she still cherished the love she once bore him, this
girl of the Antilles would fall into his embrace to forgive
and be forgiven.</p>

<p>But instead she stepped back, eluding his grasp, and
while panting with emotion, said resolutely:</p>

<p>"Stand back, Senor Roderic&mdash;touch me not I command
you!"</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak"><a name="Chapter_VI" id="Chapter_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI.<br />

<small>ON THE BORDERS OF PARADISE.</small></h2>


<p>While Owen had doubtless encountered many rude
shocks during his adventurous life he never had such a
staggering blow dealt him as when this beauty from the
Antilles so peremptorily ordered him to approach no
nearer.</p>

<p>Unconsciously he obeyed, and yet seemed amazed at
himself for not crushing her form in his embrace as he
had done in times gone by when the whole realm of earth
had been centered in her beloved presence.</p>

<p>Had she then ceased to love him&mdash;true, he had been
cruel in his judgment, but since on his part time had effected
no apparent cure, could it be possible that she despised
where once she adored?</p>

<p>He searched for an answer, nor did he have to look
long.</p>

<p>Under his troubled gaze burning blushes swept over
her face and neck&mdash;she trembled with the intensity of
her emotions, her breath came in quick, spasmodic gasps,
and she looked like a beautiful fluttering bird facing its
fate.</p>

<p>Love still reigned in her heart where he had once been
king.</p>

<p>Then why this strange action&mdash;while yet loving did she
mean to sacrifice this man who to her had been a god,
however gross his material may have appeared to other
eyes?</p>

<p>Was resentment, the desire to avenge her wrongs paramount
to love?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>While the ways of womankind were not wholly a sealed
book to Owen, he had always frankly confessed himself
unable to understand them. Yes, he had even drilled himself
into the habit of being surprised at nothing the sex
might do, either noble or otherwise&mdash;they were full of the
unexpected to him.</p>

<p>"You say stand back&mdash;see, I obey you. Tell me to go,
and I leave your presence forever. And yet I am wretchedly
sorry and would do all in my power to wipe out the
past, to make you believe in me as once you did. Is there
any such way&mdash;shall I have a chance, Georgia?"</p>

<p>He knew the power of his voice over her&mdash;he could see
her bosom heave with the intensity of her feelings.</p>

<p>Still she did not yield&mdash;this daughter of the Antilles
was made of sterner stuff than to be swept along by every
passing breeze like the fallen leaves of autumn.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," she replied, slowly.</p>

<p>"You would impose conditions&mdash;well, it is only right
and fair. Let them be what they will I am ready to undertake
them. The harder the better, since by that
means I can prove the strength of my love, the bitterness
with which I regard my conduct of the past."</p>

<p>"I said perhaps. Have you forgotten what I declared
last night?" and her eyes dropped in confusion.</p>

<p>"You warned me&mdash;you saved me from a complication
that was intended to injure me with my employers, with
those whose respect I held dear. You risked much to
warn me, and it was the thought of this that renewed my
courage, my hope."</p>

<p>"It was something else&mdash;something of a more personal
nature."</p>

<p>Then her meaning flashed upon him.</p>

<p>"You refer to Cousin Cleo&mdash;ah! what you said cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
be true&mdash;her regard for me is warm and cousinly, as mine
is for her, but that is all."</p>

<p>"And if it were true&mdash;if she did love you&mdash;devotedly
with all her heart and soul, Senor Roderic?"</p>

<p>"It would make no difference. I should deplore such
an unfortunate occurrence deeply, on her account, for she
is a noble woman in a million. But it would be utterly
impossible for me to love another as I have you, Georgia."</p>

<p>And he believed what he said, showing that he was sincere,
at any rate.</p>

<p>His words made her eyes glisten with delight, for who
does not yearn to hear such phrases falling from the lips
of an adored one.</p>

<p>"You solemnly swear that is true?" she asked, willing
to believe, yet filled with womanly doubts.</p>

<p>"By everything sacred, by the memory of that happy
past which my wretched jealousy slaughtered, by the
grave of my revered mother I swear that I love and have
loved no woman on earth but one, and she is before me."</p>

<p>"Then you shall hear the condition upon which you
may wipe out the past&mdash;upon which I shall again believe
in you with all my heart and soul, and forget the cruel
wrong you did me."</p>

<p>"Name it, for Heaven's sake, Georgia. You shall
see that I am in deadly earnest&mdash;that I abhor myself for
the miserable way in which I fled from happiness and you.
Yes, though it take me to the ends of the world, I shall go,
proud to convince you that as once before I am above all
others your <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">preux chevalier</i>. What would you have me
do&mdash;all I ask is that it may not be to the prejudice of my
beloved country for which I have sworn to stand to the
death against all her foreign foes."</p>

<p>"Find Leon for me!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a marvelously strange request and quite enough
to stagger the man of whom the imperious demand was
made.</p>

<p>"Find Leon"&mdash;the lover must set out on a quest for another
man&mdash;who was Leon, what relation did he bear the
belle of San Juan, and where had he become lost since he
needed a voyage of discovery made in his behalf&mdash;Jason,
starting with his bold Argonauts in search of the Golden
Fleece might not have had half the trouble that would
come of looking for a lost man in the world wilderness of
to-day, since traveling facilities were limited in those
times, whereas one may now readily fling thousands of
leagues behind him in a fortnight.</p>

<p>"Find Leon&mdash;for me!"</p>

<p>Evidently Leon was of considerable importance to the
speaker&mdash;her voice seemed to dwell upon the sound with
much tenderness.</p>

<p>But Roderic did not appear to be amazed on account of
the name&mdash;it was something else that gave him cause for
astonishment.</p>

<p>"Senorita, I declared my readiness to go to the ends of the
earth to serve you, but now you ask me to seek the shades
beyond, the world of spirits. How then could I claim the
reward even if success attended my endeavor?"</p>

<p>"No, no, not that&mdash;you do not understand&mdash;it is Leon,
my brother you are to find," breathlessly.</p>

<p>"Exactly, and as he is dead it would necessitate my becoming
a disembodied spirit&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah! yes, but he is not dead."</p>

<p>"Pardon, you told me so many times, and I mourned
with you on account of your loss."</p>

<p>"It was all a terrible mistake."</p>

<p>"And Leon is not dead?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>"At least he was alive three months ago. Oh! you do
not know, you cannot understand the great joy with which
I but recently learned how we had all been deceived."</p>

<p>Her face glowed with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Every atom of his old mad idolatry seemed resurrected,
and Roderic was almost ready to bend down in order to
kiss the hem of her garment, he felt so abased on account
of the wrong his hasty action had brought upon her.</p>

<p>"Where am I to search?" he asked, eagerly, as though
ready to start on the jump.</p>

<p>"He is in Porto Rico."</p>

<p>"Good. That is where I am going to-morrow."</p>

<p>"And whither we also expect to bring up as soon as
steam can take us."</p>

<p>"Tell me what you know of him, this brother who was
dead, yet lives. How shall I know him?"</p>

<p>"Ah! you would recognize him, Senor Roderic, did you
but meet on the ocean as castaways, or in the midst of the
Great Sahara."</p>

<p>"Then he looks like you?"</p>

<p>"They have always said it."</p>

<p>"That is enough&mdash;I shall remember always."</p>

<p>"And you undertake the mission?" eagerly.</p>

<p>His eyes met her glowing orbs.</p>

<p>"You have yourself named the condition, Georgia. If
I find this brother you will forgive me the cruel past&mdash;you
promise to love me again?"</p>

<p>"Ah, senor, I have never been able to crush that love
from my heart&mdash;it is as strong there to-day as when we
pledged our lives to happiness. Stay, do not misunderstand
me," as he made a movement toward her, "until
you have done something to atone for your desertion,
Senor Roderic, we may not resume those relations."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>"And should fate baffle my search&mdash;should Leon be
actually dead, do I lose all, sweetheart&mdash;will you throw
my love away like an old glove?"</p>

<p>"I could not, for your love is life to me. I have hoped
through these gloomy years, hoped you might learn how
cruel, how unjust you had been, and return to me. If
you search with all your heart, that will answer my demands."</p>

<p>"How eagerly I shall try let Heaven be my witness.
During the long and dreary months since last I saw you,
dear girl, I have lived ages. Many times rebellion arose
within my heart, fermented by the love that lingered there,
and could only be put down with an iron hand. Now I
shall hope to make such poor amends as lie in my power
for the wretched mistakes of that dreadful past. But tell
what you know of Leon&mdash;why has he been dead to you so
long, and what reason have you to believe he still lives and
is in Porto Rico?"</p>

<p>"You think it strange&mdash;it is right to look at it in that
way. I myself sometimes doubt whether I am awake, it
all seems so marvelous, so startling.</p>

<p>"Leon was my only brother&mdash;I have told you before
how we once loved each other, and even described how he
was drawn to join the brave Cubans under Gomez when
they rebelled against the mother country.</p>

<p>"In one of the first fights that occurred Leon was taken
prisoner, and carried to Havana where he was secretly
confined in Morro Castle.</p>

<p>"Suddenly we heard that he had been taken out under
the castle walls with seven other wretched patriots and
shot to death.</p>

<p>"That was about the time I met you, senor, and my
aching heart found solace in your devoted love. Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
came the period of our happiness and the shock of your
desertion.</p>

<p>"Days, months, yes years have since passed. Then, as
though the dark clouds would roll away together, I again
saw your blessed face, and at the same time heard a wonderful
story that Leon was alive&mdash;that he had been saved
by the daughter of the officer in command of Morro Castle,
who had fallen in love with his handsome face."</p>

<p>"That is not so wonderful, senorita, since you tell me
he resembles <em>you</em>."</p>

<p>"Ah! flatterer; but you shall hear all, though the time is
not appropriate. Strange things happen in Havana&mdash;in
all Spanish speaking countries&mdash;romance has a home
there, and plays a part you colder Anglo-Saxons hardly
understand."</p>

<p>"You forget I have lived there myself&mdash;that I speak
Spanish, and by direct association discovered the good
qualities of these people who are almost enigmas to the
common run of Americans. I believe in giving the devil
his due. Yes, you cannot surprise me very much. I too
have seen many remarkable dramas played under the
crimson and gold banner of Spain."</p>

<p>"This daughter of the governor saved Leon. She bribed
the prison doctor who pronounced my brother dead while
in reality he only lay in a stupor caused by a subtle drug.</p>

<p>"He was carried from the prison in a coffin and buried
just as the sun went down.</p>

<p>"Then darkness came as the grave diggers turned back
to the fort.</p>

<p>"Hardly were they out of sight than from a <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'chapparal'">chaparral</ins>
where she had remained hidden sprang the governor's
daughter, may the saints protect her as an angel of mercy.</p>

<p>"At her side was a faithful negro, and while the fire-flies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
spangled the darkness around, this man flung back
the newly set earth.</p>

<p>"When Leon had been snatched from the rude pine box
intended for his coffin this was again buried in the ground.</p>

<p>"They carried the boy to the negro's cabin and there he
was tenderly nursed through a long and weary sickness.</p>

<p>"There he lay while I mourned as only a loving, stricken
sister could; for we believed the published account of his
death before the guns of the avenging Spanish executioners.</p>

<p>"It was six months before he was well, and during that
time he had become so mixed up in the great game of independence
that he dared not let me know even of his existence&mdash;besides,
he feared lest a breath of suspicion
should be cast upon the girl who had risked all this for his
sake, and whom he loved with heart and soul.</p>

<p>"Thus time passed on and under another name he
fought with Gomez and Garcia&mdash;wherever the flag of
Cuba waved in battle he was there, ready to lead the
charge and die if need be for the cause in which he had
enlisted.</p>

<p>"When your troops were first put ashore near Santiago
and attacked by the Spaniards, it was Leon, now a captain
in the Cuban army, who saved them from annihilation.</p>

<p>"The time had apparently come when he felt at liberty
to send me a message, and this he did through one of the
Americans. It is too long a story to tell how he accomplished
it, nor does it matter.</p>

<p>"He also sent word, believing me to be still in Porto
Rico, still in dear old San Juan, that he expected to be
there sometime in the latter part of July or early in August
and I must keep on the lookout for him.</p>

<p>"Between us, Senor Roderic, we must find Leon! If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
he comes to me I shall count it the same as though you
had won your case, since the desire to do this service for
me is there."</p>

<p>"Ah! you are forgiving&mdash;you are an angel, dearest girl.
No matter, I shall never excuse myself for my unfounded
suspicions."</p>

<p>"You no longer believe in them?"</p>

<p>"I have not this long time back. Reason was fast driving
me to again visit San Juan and discover how deeply I
had wronged you."</p>

<p>"Would you have done that?"</p>

<p>"I swear that such a thought, amounting almost to a
resolution, was in my mind, when I learned fortune was
again sending me to San Juan."</p>

<p>She showed the pleasure that was rioting in her heart&mdash;the
reconciliation seemed drawing very near.</p>

<p>"And you leave&mdash;to-morrow, senor?"</p>

<p>"Yes, the sooner I get away from Dublin the better for
all purposes. I have discovered that the mission of those
who sought aid here has been balked. Just now the sentiment
of the Irish toward England seems softened, and
it looks as though by means of kindness and justice, the
wrongs of the past may be washed out. We who love the
best interests of this green isle hope for great things."</p>

<p>"You go to New York, that great city of which you so
often spoke, but which I have never yet seen?"</p>

<p>"No, direct to Porto Rico."</p>

<p>"Indeed. I did not know there were any regular vessels
going to Spanish ports in the West Indies."</p>

<p>"This is a special trip."</p>

<p>"Ah! I begin to see. We too, leave to-morrow. Can it
be possible you have taken passage on the same boat, the
Sterling Castle, a fleet blockade runner?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>Eagerness was written on her lovely face.</p>

<p>Roderic could almost wish he had been lucky enough to
have done so, believing that it must have proven a happy
voyage for them.</p>

<p>He failed to take into account the elements that would
naturally be in charge of such a vessel, and the strong
probability that his form must grace a yard arm as an
American spy, ere the voyage had been half completed.</p>

<p>"I am sorry to say that opportunity is denied me. My
cousin owns a steam yacht, which she has loaded with
stores and medicines to be taken to Porto Rico, which island
she believes has been quite forgotten by Miss Barton
and her Red Cross movement. I shall be a passenger on
board, and be secretly put ashore to fulfill my
work."</p>

<p>A sudden change came over the girl's face&mdash;there was
a drop of fifty degrees in temperature. A smiling summer
sky had been blotted out by a rude wintry blizzard&mdash;the
smile gave way to a look of pain, almost a frown.
These passion flowers of the south know little of the art
that consists in concealing the emotions&mdash;honest love or
hate flashes quickly upon the countenance, for they brook
no rivals.</p>

<p>"Your cousin&mdash;Miss Fairfax of Virginia, the daughter
of a fortune, who is ready to cast all she owns at your
feet&mdash;and you are to sail with her&mdash;you will be in her
company ten days, two weeks perhaps. Santa Maria!
then you will forget me, forget everything but her blue
eyes that look like the Porto Rico skies at sunset."</p>

<p>It was almost a piteous wail to which she gave vent, and
Roderic, his heart touched, realizing that the chance for
which he yearned had come, sprang forward and threw an
arm around the girl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>She had repulsed him before, but with a fierce jealousy
raging in her heart she was no longer capable of such
heroics.</p>

<p>So she yielded herself a willing captive to his embraces&mdash;her
heart had ever been true, why should she not enjoy
a fleeting spell of bliss?</p>

<p>Looking down into her confused face upon which his
kisses were yet warm, he said, with a quiet assurance
that did much to convince her:</p>

<p>"Sweetheart, I have known Cleo all my life. I love her
as a sister, for she is a noble woman; but I never have
given and never could give her an iota of the idolatrous
passion that has filled my heart for you. You have believed
me before&mdash;trust me now. I live only in the hope
of wiping out my shameful action of the past, and of winning
you for my own. Are you satisfied?"</p>

<p>"But she cares for you, Roderic; your fair cousin!"</p>

<p>"You declare so&mdash;I can hardly believe it."</p>

<p>"But I know it&mdash;she would make a far better wife for
you than might a poor daughter of Porto Rico," weakly,
almost piteously.</p>

<p>"I am the judge of that, and I would snatch you to my
heart against all the world."</p>

<p>"She has great wealth," watching him yearningly.</p>

<p>"I love only <em>you</em>, my darling."</p>

<p>"She is cultivated, refined, as you say a noble woman,
while I am poor, with only my face and a worshiping
heart to bring you."</p>

<p>"But I adore <em>you</em>&mdash;life without you would be a dreary
waste," he steadfastly declared.</p>

<p>His simple argument convinced even the little skeptic.</p>

<p>"Then God's will be done&mdash;I am yours again when you
have fulfilled your penance, Senor Roderic."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>Just as he was about to ratify the treaty with a lover's
kiss there was a tremendous bellow, as if some mad bull
had broken loose from confinement, and into the half
darkened apartment came the tall figure of General Porfidio,
her guardian.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><a name="Chapter_VII" id="Chapter_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII.<br />

<small>THE SWORD DUEL IN THE EAST INDIAN BUNGALOW.</small></h2>


<p>Surrounded by a thousand mementoes of India as he
was, in this quaint bungalow on the Rathmines road,
Roderic Owen might well have been pardoned had he allowed
imagination to have full sway, and looked for some
offended satellite of great Buddha to appear with the advent
of that bull-like roar.</p>

<p>But it chanced that he knew the sound of old, since the
general and himself had many times enjoyed each other's
society in San Juan when Cupid ruled the camp.</p>

<p>He was not particularly anxious to meet the Porto
Rican officer just yet, but being a man who never showed
the white feather when face to face with trouble, he
wheeled to confront the hurricane just entering.</p>

<p>General Porfidio was a big man, and having a bushy
head of white hair his appearance was unusually ferocious,
nor did his fierce military mustache and his shaggy
eyebrows serve to temper the naturally bellicose looks
which a provident Nature had bestowed upon him.</p>

<p>The roar with which he usually spoke accorded well
with his whole disposition.</p>

<p>And yet Roderic had seen this terrible man of war become
as meek as a little lamb under the thumb of a pretty
girl's hand&mdash;Georgia knew how to pull his heart strings
and bring him to his knees.</p>

<p>He evidently entered the room in a tremendous whirl
of excitement.</p>

<p>"<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Por Dios!</i> so, I have discovered the villain. Roblado<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
swore he saw him enter here, and ran to inform me three
blocks away. I have galloped every foot of the distance,
and with each yard I swore a fearful oath to have his life,
that of the spy who seeks to ruin me in my own house.
You hear, sir&mdash;I have come to rid the world of a viper.
And yet, I would not have it said that Porfidio de Brabant,
with the blood of cavaliers in his veins, descended so low
as to strike an unarmed man. Turn about, Yankee, and
you will see many swords upon the wall behind you. The
light still remains good enough to allow us a few minutes
grace. It is all I want&mdash;I have not learned my lesson
for nothing. What! do you then refuse to defend yourself&mdash;then
by Our Lady I shall be obliged to spur you on
with the flat of my good blade, until I can beat some little
courage into your shrinking soul."</p>

<p>He made an aggressive movement, as if about to instantly
carry his plan into action.</p>

<p>This was more than Roderic could stand.</p>

<p>He was a fighter by nature, and no man ever had to
shake a red flag in front of his eyes in order to arouse his
ambition.</p>

<p>Even in the present instance, though he had no desire
to meet the general in an affair of honor, the awful threat
made by the Porto Rican was too much for his Irish blood.</p>

<p>Consequently he turned to the wall, remembering that
his eye had been involuntarily attracted toward a particularly
inviting looking slender Hindoo sword made of the
finest steel in the world, tempered in Damascus, where
the art has been guarded as a secret, lo, these hundreds of
years, since the turbulent time of Saracens and Crusaders
in fact.</p>

<p>Quickly Roderic snatched this blade from the wall.</p>

<p>It felt like a reliable weapon, and he no sooner clasped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
his eager fingers about the hilt than he knew he could depend
upon it to the death.</p>

<p>Having thus armed himself he whirled about, for the
dire threat of the old soldier still stung his ears, and he
was mortally afraid the other might in his anger carry it
out.</p>

<p>To a proud man like Owen, such an indignity would be
worse than the danger of meeting an attack&mdash;and especially
in <em>her</em> presence.</p>

<p>Thus, when able to flash the jewel hilted East Indian
blade around so as to cover any possible attack from the
old martinet, Roderic gave vent to an exclamation of satisfaction.</p>

<p>At home with a sword, he felt able to render a good
account of his stewardship, since he had long taken a peculiar
pride in learning the ways in which various nations
handle the weapon&mdash;a grizzled old Turk had given him
points in Constantinople&mdash;from an Algerian desert rover
he had learned how they fought with the steel when robbers
attacked the caravans&mdash;an expert Hindoo juggler
who could place an apple on a man's cranium and with a
fierce downward stroke sever it completely without harming
a hair of the other's head had taken pleasure in teaching
him a few tricks, while American cavalrymen had
made him an adept with the sabre, and a French fencing
master exhausted his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">repertoire</i> in endeavoring to beat
down his defense.</p>

<p>Taken in all, young Owen had no reason to fear any
harm when thus given a blade with which to defend himself.</p>

<p>Nor did he mean to demolish the old veteran, with
whom he had many times smoked the pipe of peace and
good fellowship, exchanging stories of world wide experiences.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>All he desired was a chance to defend himself against
furious attacks.</p>

<p>Evidently Don Porfidio had not as yet recognized the
man in the parlor of his bungalow.</p>

<p>For this, the growing shadows of coming dusk, together
with the fury that made his eyes dance in their sockets
might be held accountable, rather than any infirmities of
coming age.</p>

<p>When the old fire-eater comprehended what the other's
action really meant he gave utterance to a snort of satisfaction.</p>

<p>Nothing could please him better than a chance to air
his masterly ability with the trenchant blade he had so
proudly carried at his side&mdash;opportunities for so doing
had of late been too few and far between to fully satisfy
the vainglorious ambition of the soldier.</p>

<p>He had actually seen much stirring work in the military
service of Spain, and was seasoned by a long and
hazardous career.</p>

<p>"<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Carramba!</i>" he cried, "have we then at last one fellow
who shirks not the fray? Here's to your lung and an
easier way of taking breath."</p>

<p>But somewhat to his surprise the unknown parried his
quivering stroke with the utmost ease, and still stood there
on guard.</p>

<p>Then the old soldier waxed wroth.</p>

<p>He had been stunned at first, when his blade was so contemptuously
turned aside, for this action was not according
to the usual way Dame Fortune served such a son
of Mars.</p>

<p>Of course he gave utterance to a Spanish execration,
such as falls so readily from the lips of these excitable
people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>Then he hastily examined his sword, which was found
to be in quite as good condition as before, proving that
the fault did not lie in that quarter at least.</p>

<p>Having awakened to the knowledge that he had a job
cut out before him that would require his utmost endeavors,
Don Porfidio braced his bulky frame for a prodigious
effort.</p>

<p>As the two antagonists stood there facing one another,
like a pair of Roman gladiators about to do battle royal
the girl suddenly darted between.</p>

<p>"You must not, shall not fight!" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>The general let out a roar.</p>

<p>"Stand back, on your life, rash girl. This is a business
in which I will brook no interference."</p>

<p>"But uncle, dear uncle, you do not know&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know all I desire, and I shall make it my solemn
duty to teach this rascal a lesson he will never forget.
Therefore I command you, Georgia, to leave the room!"</p>

<p>"No, no, it would be a crime," she continued, endeavoring
to cling to his sword arm.</p>

<p>But the testy old don's fighting blood was up, and in
such a condition he would stand no interference even
from one whom he loved so dearly.</p>

<p>So with his left arm he swept the frail figure of the
San Juan belle aside, and at the same time thrust out with
his sword.</p>

<p>The weapon met that of Roderic eagerly advanced to
receive the thrust, and immediately there followed a clashing
and rasping as steel continued to smite its like.</p>

<p>Georgia, finding her efforts to keep the two men apart
futile, fell back in dismay from the flash of the writhing
swords.</p>

<p>The spectacle appeared to fascinate her for a brief time,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
so that with clasped hands she stood and gazed, her breath
coming in gasps, and with each breath a fervent prayer
that the Holy Virgin would intervene to prevent these
two men, each of whom was so dear to her, from shedding
one another's blood.</p>

<p>Then of a sudden she uttered a bubbling cry&mdash;it was
not because one or the other had gained the least advantage,
for they were still at it, hammer and tongs, the giant
man of war trying all his tricks and clever thrusts
with disheartening results&mdash;a bright thought had flashed
into the girl's bewildered brain.</p>

<p>Since Don Porfidio refused to hearken when she attempted
to explain matters, perhaps the same hoped-for
cessation of active hostilities might be attained through
another means.</p>

<p>"A light&mdash;let me find a lamp&mdash;please Heaven it may
not be too late, and these hot heads slaughter each other
while I am gone," was what she cried.</p>

<p>No one noticed her disappearance through the door
where hung the Bagdad curtains, for both of the gentlemen
had their attention fully occupied in another quarter.</p>

<p>When a ferocious old military hero with all his long
pent-up love for bloody scenes bursting forth is diligently
thrusting right and left with a keen pointed sword, his
eagerness increasing with each and every defeat of his
plans, there is little chance to observe what may be passing
even in the confines of the same apartment.</p>

<p>That was Roderic's condition.</p>

<p>True, he considered himself in no actual danger, unless
from an accidental thrust, but all the same the valorous
old don was sending them in at white heat, and as the
gloaming made it difficult to see with exactness, there
was need of great caution.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>The sparks flew whenever the hostile blades struck
violently together, and taken altogether it was about as
pretty and interesting a picture as one would wish to see.</p>

<p>When he found his favorite blows turned aside with so
masterly a hand, the general's rage began to partially give
way to admiration, for he was an ardent lover of fine
sword play no matter where found, in Arab, Moor or
Cossack.</p>

<p>He still continued to bellow, for it was a part of his
nature to do so, but mingled with his furious phrases
were cries that betokened amazement, delight, suspicion.</p>

<p>Perhaps he recognized something familiar about the
method employed by his antagonist in defending himself.</p>

<p>Swordsmen have their peculiar tactics or individualities,
that crop out strongly, and doubtless in the good old
days when Senor Owen was a welcome visitor at the
hacienda of Don Porfidio the two may have crossed blades
occasionally, if only to illustrate some point in a story.</p>

<p>In due time the Porto Rican must have puzzled out
the solution of the mystery.</p>

<p>He was not given time just now.</p>

<p>Roderic, finding that the other was making a most wicked
series of lunges at his heart, and fearful lest some accident
might occur that would place him at the mercy of
Don Porfidio, concluded to wind up the matter in a manner
that was more to his liking.</p>

<p>So he let loose a few cards which he had, figuratively
speaking, been holding up his sleeve&mdash;in other words he
let out an extra supply of ability and forced the fighting.</p>

<p>It was all up with the general.</p>

<p>He knew full well he was in the hands of a master, and
that while the duel was fated to be cut as short as he
wished, the outcome might hardly be to his liking.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>The old don had been over confident, and he now fell
into something like a panic.</p>

<p>True, he battled on with just as much vim as before,
but desperation nerved his arm rather than the old time
enthusiasm.</p>

<p>When Roderic discovered his chance he whipped the
other's supple blade out of his nerveless hand with consummate
ease.</p>

<p>Don Porfidio uttered a cry of rage and stupefaction.</p>

<p>"<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Carramba!</i> you have done it&mdash;now take your revenge,
Senor Spy!" he ejaculated, despairingly.</p>

<p>He folded his arms across his quivering chest and faced
what he supposed would be immediate death without
flinching.</p>

<p>Roderic drew back his sword, but the old warrior made
no appeal for mercy.</p>

<p>A Spaniard may appear cruel according to Anglo-Saxon
ways of looking at things, but no race of men has
shown more splendid courage in battle or upon the terrible
unknown seas of the fifteenth century.</p>

<p>Roderic turning hung his East Indian blade once more
upon the wall, doubtless to the sore amazement of the soldier.</p>

<p>It was at this juncture Georgia came hastily into the
room bearing an antique lamp which her trembling fingers
had succeeded in lighting.</p>

<p>Upon her face was an anxious, almost terrified expression,
as though she half expected to find one or both of
the men lying there in their blood.</p>

<p>To see them standing there unarmed was a joyous
revelation.</p>

<p>As for the old soldier, the truth flashed upon him with
a shock, when his eyes beheld a face he long had known.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>"Holy Father, is it <em>you</em> Senor Owen? Dolt, idiot that
I was not to recognize the familiar swing of your cunning
sword arm. I am pleased to meet you again&mdash;as,
I am furiously angry because all these months you have
neglected this sweet flower, and caused her much suffering."</p>

<p>Thus he rambled on, halting between his natural affection
for the young American, yet holding back on account
of race enmity, since Spanish and American arms
now clashed.</p>

<p>Roderic knew he had a difficult piece of work cut out
for him.</p>

<p>It had been child's play to disarm the old gentleman,
but to avoid an open rupture must tax his ingenuity.</p>

<p>Perhaps, with the help of the girl it might be made
possible.</p>

<p>At any rate he was bound to try for the sake of peace
in the family.</p>

<p>"General, that I have lost the sweet friendship, and
society of your niece and ward during all these months
is my misfortune. She has, like an angel of light, forgiven
me. It was all a terrible mistake, caused by jealousy
on my part.</p>

<p>"You as a man who has seen the world in all its phases
can understand my position. I am humiliated in her
presence. We expect to forget all that is bitter in the
past, and start afresh, for no other has held the cords to
my heart save Georgia&mdash;though I believed her lost to me
forever, I have been always faithful to our love.</p>

<p>"General, our countries are at war, but that does not
make us enemies. I would esteem it an honor to shake
your hand again and hear you say you do not bear me
malice where she has forgiven."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>The veteran was touched.</p>

<p>He was human, and it flattered him to think that this
young American, who had just disarmed him with such
ease, should still yearn for his friendly interest.</p>

<p>Don Porfidio was genial despite his exceeding gruff
ways.</p>

<p>"<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Cospita, hombre</i>, you speak fairly. If the chit of a
girl has forgiven what right have I to hold out, though
truth to tell I have made many a vow to the Virgin to
flay your back when next we met, on account of your
wretched flight. Since you ask it so sincerely, and there
was always a warm corner of my tough old heart for you
Senor Roderic, I see no reason why we should not shake
hands and resume our former friendship."</p>

<p>This pleased Owen, who was just in the act of putting
out his hand when a rough voice outside was heard calling:</p>

<p>"Senor de Brabant, have you slain the pig of a Yankee
spy&mdash;is it safe to enter?"</p>

<p>At which Don Porfidio uttered a choking exclamation
and letting his hand drop to his side stared at the face
of the young American as though the truth had flashed
through his brain like an electric bolt.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><a name="Chapter_VIII" id="Chapter_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII.<br />

<small>"ADIOS, BELOVED!"</small></h2>


<p>The old Porto Rican dignitary quickly recovered his
speech&mdash;indeed, it was seldom he could be found in a
position where his vocal organs suffered a relapse, since
it was almost as natural for Don Porfidio to fume and
roar as it was to draw breath.</p>

<p>Suspicion, which had lain dormant in his breast during
the last few minutes, on account of his surprise at discovering
the identity of his opponent in the sword duel,
now once more leaped into a fierce flame.</p>

<p>He remembered why he had rushed to his bungalow
quarters with such hot speed.</p>

<p>"The spy, yes, the Yankee spy. <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Por Dios!</i> I had almost
forgotten him. He entered here&mdash;Roblado swore it on
his honor. I have never as yet seen the rascal and I
jumped to the conclusion that you were he. Was it all
a mistake, Senor Owen&mdash;will you tell me you are not the
party Roblado saw&mdash;the party he has sworn to tear limb
from limb? I await your answer, senor, and give you my
word of honor I shall believe what you say," he said, anxiously,
eagerly.</p>

<p>Roderic smiled.</p>

<p>It was not because he lacked in respect for the doughty
general, who had backed up his hot words with his sword
as a brave man should.</p>

<p>The reference to Roblado amused Owen.</p>

<p>He pictured that fire-eater who was yearning to spill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
his blood, waiting outside the door of the house, where
the click of the swords came as sweet music to his ear,
waiting until these sounds were heard no longer, when in
a mixture of hope and fear he called out:</p>

<p>"Senor de Brabant, have you slain the pig of a Yankee
spy&mdash;is it safe to enter?"</p>

<p>Of a truth Roblado's heart was as stout as that of the
timid lamb gamboling on the green, and when he roared
it was as fiercely as a sucking dove.</p>

<p>Roderic was ever frank&mdash;it is a policy that pays best in
the end.</p>

<p>"I do not claim the name of a spy, senor, but it would
be foolish of me to deny that I am in the secret diplomatic
service of my country&mdash;that my presence here has been to
discover why Spanish agents congregate in Dublin. As
to why I am under your roof, it is a purely personal matter
that drew me. I chanced to be passing and saw your
niece at the window. Resolved to make my peace with
her I boldly demanded admittance, and she has been
angel enough to forgive. Senor, that is all&mdash;you believe
me?"</p>

<p>Roderic was a man whose very face was a passport
among his fellows.</p>

<p>What he said usually carried weight.</p>

<p>Of old he had exerted great influence over the don,
who had almost loved him as his own at the time jealousy
broke up the combination.</p>

<p>This feeling was once more sweeping over the general&mdash;there
is a fascination about some men that is very hard
to resist.</p>

<p>Possibly he might have again thrust out his hand despite
Roblado and his hatred for Yankees in general.</p>

<p>Other voices were heard outside&mdash;Roblado was endeavoring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
to explain to the new arrivals who had just
appeared upon the scene.</p>

<p>Perhaps, not having received any answer to his frenzied
calls to the general, he jumped to the conclusion that
the boot was on the other leg, and the veteran had received
his quietus at the hands of the miserable American
"pig."</p>

<p>In numbers there is courage and strength.</p>

<p>Even Roblado could be valorous when backed up by
half a dozen comrades.</p>

<p>The cramp in his abdomen, which had necessarily prevented
him from rushing in and annihilating the Yankee,
now left him as if by magic, and when the group of conspirators
crushed through the doorway Roblado led the
van.</p>

<p>Such valor! no wonder Spain has in ages past swept
like a whirlwind over the known world&mdash;it was certainly
worthy of the Dark Ages.</p>

<p>Roderic was taken at a disadvantage, for he had not
expected such hostile measures.</p>

<p>He thought to again snatch the sword that had already
served him so well, but ere this could be done one of the
new comers had hurled his weight upon him.</p>

<p>Had these two been let alone, Owen would surely have
done the other injury in short order, for his trained
muscles were aching for active service, and the Spaniard
was really no match for him.</p>

<p>This style of carrying on the affair did not seem to
suit the others, however.</p>

<p>What was the use of having an advantage if it were
not enforced?</p>

<p>Such logic carried the day, and when Roderic found
the half dozen hanging upon him from all quarters he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
ceased struggling, knowing the folly of such a useless
endeavor to win out.</p>

<p>It was a great victory.</p>

<p>His captors surrounded him, every man holding on to
some part of his apparel.</p>

<p>Their swarthy faces beamed with pleasure, as though
this might be taken as a forerunner of the great triumph
reserved for their nation when the somnolence of many
years had been thrown aside.</p>

<p>Roblado was in his element.</p>

<p>He had a military or naval cut about his appearance,
and no doubt could swell with importance when on the
deck of his ship or at the head of his brigade.</p>

<p>"Tis well, comrades, we have secured the beast. What
can prevail against Spanish valor? Those who are foolish
enough to get in our way must pay the penalty, poor
fools. Now that we have caught the great American
eagle what shall we do with him?" he asked, still maintaining
a consequential grip upon Roderic's coat tails.</p>

<p>"Clip his wings!" said one in Castilian.</p>

<p>Various other suggestions were offered, some amusing,
others diabolical in their cruelty.</p>

<p>Roderic laughed good naturedly.</p>

<p>"Ah! gentlemen all," he remarked in that calm and
pleasant way that indicates perfect control over the emotions,
"you seem to forget you are not in Spain or Cuba,
where such delightful little picnic parties as you mention
are of daily occurrence. You are in the dominion
of Her Majesty Queen Victoria&mdash;her officers are watching
every move you make, and at this moment the shadow
of Portland prison hangs over you, every man.</p>

<p>"Don't imagine for a moment my presence is not known
to these men from Scotland Yard, for we are working<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
hand in glove. I am in your power, and you may do as
you please, but mark me, if a hair of my head is injured
every man here will be in irons before two hours have
passed. That is all!"</p>

<p>It was enough.</p>

<p>The Jack Spaniards were shaky at the knees.</p>

<p>Their respect for grim English laws and customs was
bred in the bone&mdash;since the days when the Great Armada
was destroyed by Providence and British valor, these
people of the Iberian peninsula have seldom desired
to pick a quarrel with Albion.</p>

<p>So, upon hearing what Owen had to say, they looked
at each other fearfully and then eyed the doors and windows
as though half expecting to see the officers representing
good old English law bursting upon the scene.</p>

<p>Naturally a cock fights best upon his own ground, and
this is particularly true of Spaniards as a people.</p>

<p>Handicapped by their presence under a flag that was
known to be more friendly toward the Americans than
any other among the Powers, they found their claws
cut.</p>

<p>A hasty council of war was entered into.</p>

<p>Self preservation is the first law of nature, and they
were clamorous as to the means to be employed that
would best insure his safety.</p>

<p>No matter how wretched the cur, he has the same inherent
love of life that nature gives to the finest created
creature.</p>

<p>Several times Don Porfidio attempted to take the reins
and drive, but a spirit of communism was rampant, and
the others would yield to no dictation.</p>

<p>At other times perhaps they would give ready heed to
all he had to say, since he occupied a high position in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
the councils of Spain; but just now all were on a common
level and it was a case of life and death they had to settle.</p>

<p>At length it was decided.</p>

<p>Senor Owen should not be put to death, but held a
prisoner until they could hastily leave Dublin bay on
board the blockade runner as per their previous arrangement.</p>

<p>It was only hastening plans that had already been well
arranged.</p>

<p>The young girl stood there an anxious spectator, while
her lover's fate was being decided, and when the final
ultimatum had been rendered she gave him a pleased
smile of encouragement.</p>

<p>Roderic, wise man, had made up his mind not to resist
the decree of fate, especially since it appeared that he
would only be put to a little inconvenience and encounter
small danger.</p>

<p>He had no desire to provoke the anger of these men
further than was necessary&mdash;there would come a time
when he might meet them face to face on equal terms,
with weapons in his hands, and until that hour it was
policy for him to laugh and let them have their sweet
way.</p>

<p>A long lane it is that has no turning.</p>

<p>His time would come sooner or later.</p>

<p>Then the blustering Roblado might be made to sing
more softly, and those who handled him so roughly be
compelled to take a turn themselves.</p>

<p>Surrounded by the voluble and excited group, the
American was led down into the cellar of the unique
bungalow on the Rathmines road.</p>

<p>Here they left him, with fervent hopes, openly expressed
that the rats would feed upon his wretched porcine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
carcass, and never allow him to again see the light
of day.</p>

<p>Owen was not in despair.</p>

<p>On the contrary it is doubtful whether in all fair Dublin
that night a lighter heart could have been found than
his.</p>

<p>There was reason for it too.</p>

<p>As to the danger menacing him, he laughed that to
scorn&mdash;it was only a little adventure after all, one of
many that marked his life.</p>

<p>He had won back the treasure that was almost beyond
his reach, and the man who found himself secure in the
love of that divine girl had cause for deep and heart-felt
satisfaction.</p>

<p>Roderic could never tell how it ever came these fellows
neglected to take what portable property he chanced to
carry.</p>

<p>It was really a remarkable omission and might be laid
to the fact of their being gentlemen though he himself
was rather inclined to believe the truth rested in another
quarter&mdash;that they had been ashamed in the presence of
Georgia, and likewise confused by his positive statement
about the Scotland Yard officers on their trail.</p>

<p>Having a deep seated aversion to English prisons,
quite excusable, they had found their nerves unstrung.</p>

<p>Hence Roderic profited by their confusion.</p>

<p>He hunted up a cigar and a match.</p>

<p>That was comfort enough for half an hour.</p>

<p>The future could take care of itself.</p>

<p>Such is the philosophy of a dare devil who, from long
familiarity has conceived a species of contempt for danger.</p>

<p>He could hear some one moving about above, and understood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
that the general must be preparing to leave the
odd little furnished cottage which he had hired.</p>

<p>More time passed.</p>

<p>Owen was only waiting until they left the house, when
he would undertake to get free from his prison.</p>

<p>No ordinary cellar was constructed that could restrain
a man of his ability for any great length of time.</p>

<p>An occasional flash from a match kept him informed as
to the flight of time.</p>

<p>These brief periods of illumination also gave him some
conception as to his surroundings, and he was thus enabled
to figure as to what shape his action should take
in order to bring the most speedy results.</p>

<p>At length all seemed to become quiet above.</p>

<p>He had heard several doors slam.</p>

<p>Doubtless the doughty general and his lovely ward had
sallied forth to board the blockade runner that was to
take them across the ocean.</p>

<p>Roderic sighed to think he would not see her again for,
Heaven alone knew how long.</p>

<p>Never mind, he had experienced a foretaste of Paradise
on this evening which he would have considered cheaply
purchased had he been compelled to meet ten times as
many difficulties in order to win it.</p>

<p>It had brightened his life and given him something
blessed for which to live.</p>

<p>Filled with zeal, as though inspired to prove himself
worthy of the dear girl who had so readily forgiven his
cruel desertion because of the great love she bore him,
Owen arose.</p>

<p>First of all he stretched himself, as though feeling of
his strength.</p>

<p>He had resolved to bend his energies upon the door<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
of the subterranean prison, as offering the best possible
opportunity for escape.</p>

<p>So he groped his way to the stone steps and made his
way upward.</p>

<p>At length he touched the door.</p>

<p>Of course it was fast.</p>

<p>Those vindictive Spaniards had meant what they said,
and really hoped he might be kept down below until so
weakened by hunger that he could put up but a feeble
defense against the great gaunt Dublin sewer rats.</p>

<p>Which shows how little they knew a progressive Yankee,
and his inventive abilities that stop at nothing when
the occasion makes demands.</p>

<p>Roderic knew how to assail such a door.</p>

<p>He smiled disdainfully when he found they had actually
left the key in the lock.</p>

<p>What a snap it was.</p>

<p>Why these fellows were hardly out of their swaddling
clothes when it came to outwitting a twentieth century
Yankee.</p>

<p>He thought he would start <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'openations'">operations</ins> upon that door
immediately.</p>

<p>Then his mind changed for a sound reached his ears&mdash;some
one was approaching&mdash;he could even see a gleam of
light from under the door.</p>

<p>Now they stood without with only the door between.</p>

<p>He heard a key turned in the lock.</p>

<p>Roderic braced himself for a struggle, not knowing but
what one of the most vindictive Spaniards, Roblado perhaps,
had crept back, resolved to have a dark revenge.</p>

<p>Thus, half crouching on the steps, he awaited the opening
of the door.</p>

<p>Now it moved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>He had a <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'glimse'">glimpse</ins> of a flaring candle held in a small
hand, and then came sudden darkness, for a draught from
the cellar had snuffed out the flame.</p>

<p>But Roderic had in that one glance seen enough to
arouse the most delightful sensations within his heart.</p>

<p>A voice, low and soft but sweeter than a breath from
Cathay reached his ears and set the music throbbing in
his heart.</p>

<p>"Senor Roderic&mdash;<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">hola</i>, it is I!"</p>

<p>"God bless you&mdash;I am here within reach. Hold steady
and let me touch you, lest I believe I am only dreaming,
my darling."</p>

<p>And he immediately held her little loyal form within
the shelter of his arms, though when he rained burning
kisses on her lips she struggled to be free.</p>

<p>"This is no time for that. Holy mother, what a rude
man you are, Senor Roderic. Release me, I beg, I
command. Remember he must win who wears. You
have a duty to perform."</p>

<p>"Which shall be accomplished with Heaven's help. But
I thought you were gone, sweetheart?"</p>

<p>"We are just starting&mdash;the cart is at the door, and
uncle is waiting."</p>

<p>"Then he knows why you return?"</p>

<p>"Yes. He made only one stipulation."</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"Your promise not to move a hand until dawn, to prevent
our sailing on the Sterling Castle."</p>

<p>Roderic breathed easier.</p>

<p>"Tell the dear old governor I give that most willingly.
You know I leave here myself in a comparatively few
hours."</p>

<p>"Then I must go."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>"You leave me&mdash;we may never meet again."</p>

<p>"The Virgin watch over you," she faltered.</p>

<p>"Will you go without one parting embrace&mdash;ah! the
world is wide and danger lurks everywhere when people
are at war. One kiss sweetheart, of your own free will&mdash;it
may be a talisman to guard me against evil."</p>

<p>He pleaded not in vain.</p>

<p>A pair of soft arms were thrown around his neck, and
not one but a dozen kisses rained upon his lips&mdash;then
when he would have sought to detain her she eluded
his grasp and flitted away in the dark, her gentle "adios,
beloved," sounding like a benediction to his ravished ears.</p>

<p>A few minutes later he heard the roll of wheels, as
the jaunting car took them to the distant quay.</p>

<p>"She is gone, Heaven bless her," he muttered&mdash;"lucky
man that I am, thrice blessed to be beloved by two such
charming creatures; to me there is only one who can
fill the longing of my heart and she has just left me."</p>

<p>And this was the reason Roderic turned up at the
Shelbourne late that night looking like a man who had
supped with adventure.</p>

<small>DOWN THE IRISH COAST.</small></h2>


<p>When Roderic Owen saw the look of deep concern on
his cousin's face give way to a radiant expression as
he entered the door of the hotel, his heart reproached
him.</p>

<p>Here he had been actually reveling in the realms of
bliss for the last three hours or more, while Cleo, judging
from her appearance, had been "plunged in a gulf
of dark despair," or at least considerably worried over
the fact of his singular disappearance.</p>

<p>It was really too bad.</p>

<p>Her faithful heart had yearned after him, just as a
loving sister's might for the absent one&mdash;the two girls
were so entirely unlike in looks and temperament that
it never occurred to him to compare Cleo's affection
with that of Georgia&mdash;and yet it was of the kind that lasts
through life.</p>

<p>Feeling that somehow he had caused Cleo considerable
anxiety, and being conscience stricken on account of his
own present happiness, Roderic advanced hastily to ascend
the broad stairs and meet her on the landing above.</p>

<p>"You were worried about me, dear cousin?"</p>

<p>"Naturally so&mdash;all day you have been away&mdash;and to-morrow
we sail&mdash;unless something important has happened,
to alter your plans," she replied, her face flushing
at the eager manner in which he caught her hand.</p>

<p>"Something important <em>has</em> happened, but it will not delay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
our leaving Dublin to-morrow," he replied, mentally
deciding that the time had come for him to confide his
secret to this tender heart.</p>

<p>If it brought pain, God forgive him, since he was unwittingly
the cause, but sooner or later Cleo must learn
the truth, and the occasion seemed to demand that he
speak now.</p>

<p>They were alone, but it was very public&mdash;perhaps a
quiet nook in one of the small parlors would suit better
for a confessional.</p>

<p>"Come with me, dear cousin&mdash;I have much to tell you&mdash;much
that concerns my past and promises to control
my future," he said, earnestly.</p>

<p>"Ah," thought Cleo, as she followed his eager steps,
"it is coming&mdash;he has seen her again, this Georgia whom
he knew and loved in San Juan. I must crush down my
own feelings in the matter and appear just what he believes
me&mdash;an affectionate comrade, a loving sister."</p>

<p>That was a heroine for you&mdash;it is not given of all
women to be Joan of Arcs, but occasion may arise in
any life calling for as much determined spirit and heroism
as the noble Maid of Orleans ever boasted.</p>

<p>The bijou parlor was entirely deserted, though still
lighted, and over in a cozy corner where a pile of cushions
invited Oriental comfort they settled down for a
little private talk.</p>

<p>Some men would have opened up in an evasive manner
and told as little as necessity demanded.</p>

<p>Not so Roderic Owen.</p>

<p>When a task was set before him, no matter how unpleasant
or embarrassing, his method was to plunge
squarely into it, neither sparing himself nor seeking glory
from the recital.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>So he told how he had met the lovely belle of the Porto
Rico capital&mdash;the strange and romantic manner in which
Providence seemed to delight in throwing them together,
and how he was enabled to save her great inconvenience,
if not her life&mdash;of the mutual attachment that naturally
sprang up between them that rapidly ripened into a
passion&mdash;of their engagement and the glorious weeks
succeeding, when they lived in Paradise.</p>

<p>Then came the serpent in Eden&mdash;coquetry on the girl's
part, rank jealousy on his, without just cause it had
proved.</p>

<p>After that, hot words, violent separation&mdash;the old, old
story of wounded hearts, so many times repeated in the
history of the world&mdash;of two souls intended for each
other, wandering about the earth estranged, because of
hasty temper.</p>

<p>To all of this Cleo listened with deepest sympathy
marked upon her face.</p>

<p>What pain her heart experienced would never be
known to the world, for she crushed this down with a
resolute hand.</p>

<p>Woman was created to withstand most of the suffering
in this world&mdash;Providence endowed her with a
larger capacity for such endurance than man; just as the
lord of creation was given the spirit of the chase, of battle,
and as the bread-winner in life's strife.</p>

<p>Finally Roderic brought the story to Dublin and told
how Georgia disguised as a Sister of the Holy Grail,
warned him, though so well had she concealed her identity
that he had not guessed it until after she had gone.</p>

<p>This brought him down to the time he was passing
on the Rathmine car, and had a glimpse of the girl he
loved in the window of the quaint East India bungalow.</p>

<p>He was a good story teller, and the subject one in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
which his whole heart was engaged, so that he quickly
held the girl spell-bound as he described how the reconciliation
was brought about.</p>

<p>When he finally told how Georgia allowed him to
take her in his arms, Cleo smiled to hide the aching
heart she carried, and which she feared might betray its
pain upon her face.</p>

<p>Of course she thought that was the end.</p>

<p>"You love her with a deathless devotion, cousin&mdash;she
has become a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sine qua non</i> to your existence?" she
remarked, to hide her little tremor, her pallor and any
confusion that might appear.</p>

<p>"She is the life of my life&mdash;I had gone to the point
of being an old bachelor, cousin, without ever falling
in love&mdash;indeed, I had begun to doubt seriously whether
my nature was capable of any passion, for my devotion to
your cousinly self had been the only affection I had ever
known&mdash;when she crossed my path like a brilliant meteor
and from that day to this I have not known the old
peace. Yes, I love her with heart and soul&mdash;as you
say it truly seems as though this dark-eyed girl had become
an indispensable condition to my existence. I tell
you this knowing how much you care for my happiness&mdash;how
you sympathize with my griefs and rejoice when
prosperity finds me."</p>

<p>Perhaps it was cruel to say this, but remember that
Owen found it almost impossible to believe Cleo entertained
a passion for him beyond that calm, cousinly
affection.</p>

<p>Besides, it was a part of his religion that heroic
treatment was always best.</p>

<p>If he had an unpleasant duty to perform the sooner
it was done the better for his peace of mind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>"You say this happened at about dusk?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, I was hurrying to the hotel to dress so that I
might eat dinner with you."</p>

<p>"Possibly at seven," with an arch glance in the direction
of a little ormolu clock upon the mantel, that was
merrily ticking away the minutes.</p>

<p>Roderic laughed in some confusion.</p>

<p>"Pray, do not imagine I forgot the lapse of time,
since it is now after eleven. Truth to tell I have been a
prisoner all this time&mdash;not a captive held by Love's
silken strands as you suspect."</p>

<p>"A prisoner&mdash;oh! Roderic, then that reconciliation was
not the end?" she exclaimed, remembering that his appearance
was hardly that of a gentleman who exhibited as
a usual thing some fastidiousness in his dress.</p>

<p>"Rather it was but the beginning, for at that very
moment the gruff old general, her uncle, rushed like a
whirlwind into the house, bellowing for a chance to annihilate
the Yankee spy whom one of his bold colleagues
had seen enter."</p>

<p>"That was exciting enough&mdash;I am quite anxious to see
that odd old soldier of whom you have spoken so much.
But go on&mdash;he recognized you?"</p>

<p>"Not at all&mdash;the dim light and his passion blinded
eyes prevented that. At once he demanded that I take
my choice of the various swords on the wall and give
him an opportunity to wipe out the insult my presence
put upon his dwelling."</p>

<p>"What a ferocious old firebrand he must be. And
did she not explain&mdash;you said she had usually such power
over this uncle?"</p>

<p>"He would not let her say anything, but, wild with anger
brushed Georgia aside and swore as only a furious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
Spaniard could, that unless I at once accepted his benevolent
offer of a fair chance to defend myself, he would lay
the flat of his sword on me, and use his boot in ejecting
me from the premises."</p>

<p>"The old brute&mdash;and of course after that, Cousin Roderic,
you had to fight?"</p>

<p>"There was no other way of escaping the dilemma. So
I snatched a sword from the wall and met his attack.
Well, we had quite a lively passage at arms for some minutes.
As I had fenced with the old governor often before
I knew he was behind the times. Georgia had fled from
the room to hunt a lamp. Just as she returned fortune
allowed me to disarm the general."</p>

<p>"Ah! yes, it is always fortune and good luck when you
manage to succeed, cousin mine," she exclaimed with
some heat, "but I know what skill you possess with a
sword&mdash;I have my own opinion on that score. But go
on&mdash;Georgia returned with a light at this most interesting
juncture?"</p>

<p>"And the general recognized me&mdash;he was almost paralyzed,
and was ready to forgive my miserable treatment of
his niece when he learned that she had done so. Unfortunately
his friends rushed in at this juncture, and taking
me unawares made me a prisoner."</p>

<p>"Not before one or more had suffered at your hands,
I warrant," she asserted, stoutly, for since Roderic would
not sound his own trumpet it was necessary that some one
else blow it for him.</p>

<p>Ah! the man who has such a faithful heart looking after
his interests is blest indeed.</p>

<p>"Well, I must confess I did not inflict much punishment
upon them because they hung on like so many leeches,
quite overpowering me. Besides, I knew they would
hardly dare do me any bodily harm."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>Then he told what followed, and how they put him in
the cellar to clip his wings, as they said.</p>

<p>Finally came the last scene in the drama where the door
opened and he had Georgia in his arms again.</p>

<p>Roderic made little of this, for the conviction was now
forcing itself upon even his dull masculine mind that such
tender scenes might not be in the best taste possible, considering
the circumstances.</p>

<p>"And thus you see me on deck once more, a little the
worse for wear perhaps, but ready to sail with you to-morrow,
if you say the word," he ended.</p>

<p>"You are happy, Roderic?"</p>

<p>"Yes, God has been very, very good to me. I don't deserve
it, cousin."</p>

<p>"You look forward to meeting Georgia in the island
beyond the sea?"</p>

<p>"She has already started there, and it would be strange
if we did not meet, either before or after San Juan falls
into American hands."</p>

<p>"Is she&mdash;<em>very</em> beautiful, Roderic?"</p>

<p>"You shall say for yourself when you see her, for it is
my fondest hope that you may be the dearest of friends.
You will promise me that, Cleo?"</p>

<p>Again she resolutely thrust self aside.</p>

<p>"Whom you love must be a sister to me, cousin. Yes, I
give you such a promise willingly."</p>

<p>The rebellion in her heart was kept down with a firm
hand&mdash;what was human might struggle and cry out, but it
could not overcome the divine element that came from
Calvary&mdash;the desire to sacrifice self for the good of one
beloved.</p>

<p>Then they fell to talking of the contemplated ocean voyage
and what pleasures it promised to souls that delighted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
in travel, and for which the ever changing boundless deep
had charms that were invisible to the eye of the ordinary
tourist.</p>

<p>Finally Roderic realized the lateness of the hour, and
declared he ought to be ashamed to keep his cousin from
her beauty sleep, especially as it was all on account of his
own personal business.</p>

<p>Possibly Roderic slept but little that night.</p>

<p>He had much upon his mind.</p>

<p>And yet he was far happier than the girl from Virginia,
since there was a bright future to which he could look
forward.</p>

<p>With her that future was a blank.</p>

<p>Many there are fated in this world to love without hope
of a reciprocal affection, but few can bear their cross with
the gentle happy spirit shown by Cleo.</p>

<p>When they met again at an early breakfast, while old
Dublin was waking up, no one would suspect from her
smiling face and dancing blue eyes that Cleo had ever
known a serious sorrow, or that a canker lodged close to
her gentle heart.</p>

<p>She took the deepest interest in all the contemplated
movements of her cousin, and entered into the enthusiasm
of his plans as though she had a reason to share in his
future happiness.</p>

<p>Matters had been so carefully adjusted on the preceding
day that little remained to be done save have their portable
luggage taken down to the landing stage, and go through
with a few forms necessary ere the steam yacht could depart.</p>

<p>Though Roderic was not sorry to leave Dublin, under
the circumstances, he must always cherish a pleasant
recollection for the bright Irish capital.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>It was here the incubus that had pressed upon his
shoulders for well nigh two years had been cast aside, and
the sun of hope burst from behind the clouds of despair.</p>

<p>Yes, the name of Dublin would ever be associated with
pleasant memories, for the little encounter with Don Porfidio
was but a romance; while his capture and imprisonment
by the Spanish clique had only been the means of
bringing his beloved sweetheart again to his arms, and he
could not harbor ill feelings against any cause that had
brought about such an effect.</p>

<p>By ten o'clock they were on board the yacht.</p>

<p>Roderic could not help casting many eager glances
around at the various vessels lying at anchor in Kingstown
harbor.</p>

<p>He was thinking of the Sterling Castle.</p>

<p>Already he had made inquiries concerning the steamer,
and knew her build.</p>

<p>There were several marked peculiarities about her style,
the painting of her funnel and other things that would
stamp her individuality, so that he was able to declare
after searching the harbor, that the impudent little blockade
runner was not present.</p>

<p>Then she had about twelve hours the start and was
doubtless far down the Irish coast.</p>

<p>The anchor was weighed with the usual cheery English
chorus, and as the steam yacht headed into Dublin bay,
Roderic, looking back to the beautiful city thus left behind,
could not but be impressed.</p>

<p>It was a glorious summer day and the sight an inspiring
one, for Kingstown harbor at this season of the year
is usually thronged with pleasure craft as well as those of
business.</p>

<p>Going out they passed the Holyhead steamer just entering.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>Roderic could not but reflect with deep satisfaction
what a great change had taken place in his own life since
he trod the hurricane deck of that same steamer a short
time before.</p>

<p>Truly events follow each other in rapid succession in
some lives.</p>

<p>Providence seemed to be in an especially favoring mood
with regard to his fortunes just at present.</p>

<p>If it would only continue.</p>

<p>He knew not what the future held&mdash;perhaps, could he
have lifted the veil and obtained a glimpse of what adventures
and perils lay in his path, the prospect might
have appalled even his stout heart.</p>

<p>How mercifully the future is screened from our inquisitive
eyes&mdash;could we but <em>know</em>, how idle would our struggles
seem, and despair must often cause us to cease the
hopeless contest.</p>

<p>It is this element of uncertainty that keeps hope alive in
our hearts, and many times wrings victory from seeming
defeat.</p>

<p>As they passed down the far famed Irish sea the tops
of the green hills could always be seen above the haze
that sometimes hid their base and the fishing villages
nestling there from view.</p>

<p>Roderic spent much time in leaning over the rail and
watching this everchanging panorama, while smoking his
pipe&mdash;for Cleo had made it distinctly understood that she
was very fond of tobacco smoke in the open air, and that
he was at liberty to indulge when and where he chose; a
privilege that caused Miss Becky to lift her eyes in horror,
for she had a special aversion to this self same odor.</p>

<p>However, she never found Roderic other than a gentleman,
and he would always move his seat in order that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
the fragrant smoke might not blow across her sacred person,
so that in this way he made a firm friend of the old
maid.</p>

<p>When nightfall came they took their last look at old
Ireland's green hills, for unless all calculations failed they
would be out on the broad Atlantic by daylight, headed
for the West Indies.</p>

<p>Roderic had by this time thrown off the reserve that
weighed down his spirits at first and become his own
sociable self, ready to enter into any game that promised
relaxation and sport.</p>

<p>The shore line faded as the glow left the western sky,
and presently only lights upon the hills told how near they
were to the Irish coast.</p>

<p>Thus the voyage was begun, that would bring much of
success or grief to his fortunes&mdash;before him like a will-o'-the-wisp
flitted the blockade runner, having on board
the beautiful maid of San Juan&mdash;and the game was transferred
from the Old to the New World.</p>

<div class="chapter">

</div>

<h2 class="nobreak"><a name="Chapter_X" id="Chapter_X"></a>CHAPTER X.<br />

<small>FOR ONE NIGHT AT THE AZORES.</small></h2>


<p>In heading for the Antilles there were several routes
which they could take.</p>

<p>It was possible to make a bee line almost due south-west,
stopping at the Azores on the way; or they could
follow the plan adopted by Spain in sending her ships of
war across, heading almost due south to the Canary islands,
then on nearly the same course until the Cape
Verdes were reached, after which a run to the west would
bring them to the Porto Rico coast.</p>

<p>Roderic was much interested in this matter and held
many consultations with the old captain as to what line he
had marked out.</p>

<p>Perhaps&mdash;for somehow our purely selfish personal ends
will crop up despite us&mdash;he was speculating as to what
chances they had of overtaking the blockade runner,
should they have decided upon the same course.</p>

<p>There are always so many possibilities governing these
things.</p>

<p>Though the ocean appears limitless, there are times
when people come together in a most remarkable manner.</p>

<p>Fate takes a hand in many a game and this seemingly
boundless sea becomes as a veritable mill pond, where
boys float their rafts and have collisions.</p>

<p>Roderic learned that their course was to be laid by way
of the Azores, those sentinels of the vasty deep that lie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
far out in midocean between the two warring countries,
the United States and Spain.</p>

<p>He spent a portion of the first morning afloat in examining
the vessel from keel to truck so to speak, and was
loud in his praise of her stanch abilities.</p>

<p>She had been built on the Clyde, and was of course
put together to stay&mdash;those canny Scots have a faculty
for making timbers hold together through hurricane
blows and all manner of extreme usage, that is unexcelled
in any other part of the world, so that the very name carries
weight; as does the Belfast engine, some of which on
old White Star liners have done noble duty a score and a
half of years.</p>

<p>Roderic's praise was so unstinted that the old captain,
who loved his craft as only a seaman may, was quite
tickled.</p>

<p>He had taken a great liking for Owen, which was not at
all strange, for they were both men built very much upon
the same model, possessing sterling characteristics.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was apt to become something of a mutual
admiration society, for Roderic recognized a kindred
spirit&mdash;what he admired in a man and sought to exemplify
in his own person was present in the composition of this
rough and ready British sailorman.</p>

<p>It also pleased him to know Cleo had been fortunate
enough to secure such a reliable mariner, and yet he realized
this was as much the result of good judgment on her
part as any luck.</p>

<p>At least he would never suspect that the Virginia maid
had immediately fancied the grim old mariner because
she discovered many of his sterling characteristics to be
the same as those she had admired in Roderic from boyhood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>That was her secret which she would hardly have acknowledged
even to her own heart.</p>

<p>The weather too was propitious.</p>

<p>A splendid breeze blew, and as they were provided with
sails, these were utilized in order to further increase their
speed.</p>

<p>Roderic gloried in the fact that he had never been sea
sick a minute in his life, and he had also seen some pretty
rough times afloat, from being caught in a dreadful typhoon
in the China sea to being wrecked by a West India
hurricane.</p>

<p>He had provided himself with Clarke Russell's latest
ocean yarn, and as his own condition was fully equal to
that so aptly described by this wizard of sea stories, he
could doubly appreciate the vivid descriptions of storm
and calm, hot chase and wreck, and all the manifold
phases of life on the boundless deep, given in a manner
that has never been rivaled.</p>

<p>They also played shuffle board, tossed deck quoits and
amused themselves as pilgrims on the briny ocean learn
to do when time hangs heavy.</p>

<p>Roderic read aloud some of the most remarkable passages
which bore the witchery of pen genius, and glancing
up at the swelling white sails or around at the watery
horizon only marked by a wave crest circle, they were in a
position to feel the vigor of the description such as no
landsman, lounging in a hammock, far from the sea,
which mayhap he had never gazed upon, could ever experience.</p>

<p>Numerous vessels were sighted during the first day,
steamers and sailing craft.</p>

<p>There is always keen pleasure watching these pilgrims
of the deep through the glasses and surmising what they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
are, the nature of their cargo, whence they come and
whither bound.</p>

<p>After this day such sights would become more rare,
for their course was out of the usual transatlantic run.</p>

<p>Doubtless in the good old days when galleons laden
with silver and other treasures from the Spanish Main
and Mexican mines were on this route to Spain, many a
piratical craft bore along this self same course with men
alow and aloft on the keen lookout for rich prizes which
could be looted, and scuttled with their wretched crews,
their fate ever to remain one of the mysteries of the
mighty deep.</p>

<p>Such romantic thoughts crept into Roderic's mind&mdash;the
situation was conducive to their inception.</p>

<p>Besides, his own fortunes were really as much tinged
with the spicy flavor of adventure and romance as any he
could imagine in connection with those olden days.</p>

<p>Another day and they apparently owned the earth&mdash;at
least from sunrise to sunset not a vessel was sighted
going in any direction.</p>

<p>The spouting of whales, the gyrations of sharks indicated
by the sword-like dorsal fin sticking out of the
water, and such aquatic features were all that broke the
monotony of the livelong day.</p>

<p>Roderic many times scanned the horizon ahead, and the
sight of a distant steamer was enough to arouse his eager
interest, for he could not get it out of his mind that the
girl he so passionately loved was somewhere on that vast
deep, and there was always a possibility of the speedy
steam yacht overtaking the slower blockade runner.</p>

<p>Some people hang their faith on small things, lovers
especially.</p>

<p>It is possible to find a needle in a haystack, and yet it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
would hardly pay one to devote a great length of time in
the search.</p>

<p>However, lusty hope buoys the heart up, and often leads
to wonderful accomplishments.</p>

<p>A change came in the weather.</p>

<p>One can not always expect favoring winds and clear
skies on the fretful Atlantic&mdash;the storms will blow in summer
as well as during the cold season.</p>

<p>Cleo had assured Roderic of her faith in the Dreadnaught
as a stanch boat in case of rough weather.</p>

<p>He found the yacht more seaworthy than he had believed
possible.</p>

<p>She rode the mighty rollers like a duck, and at no time
was there danger aboard.</p>

<p>Still, this was only a sample of what the old Atlantic
could kick up on occasion, and no matter how good the
boat, one who has experienced the horrors of a genuine
hurricane while afloat, never feels a hankering after its
repetition&mdash;there is a majesty about the mighty deep when
aroused to fury that awes the stoutest human heart; and
those who have sailed over its trackless wastes the longest
have the greatest respect for its sovereignty.</p>

<p>Of course the storm drove them out of their expected
direct route to the Portuguese Azores, and delayed their
arrival at the sentinel islands.</p>

<p>Although these islands be along the short route from
Spain to her West India possessions,&mdash;to be hers no
longer&mdash;as a usual thing ships from the mother country
prefer the longer passage, partly because the runs are
more broken, the wind more apt to be favorable, and
possibly for the reason that some of her fortified possessions,
the Canaries lie off the coast of northern Africa.</p>

<p>Thus, not a great business has been done at the Azores<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
under the best of conditions, and this was interfered with
while the war lasted, as Spanish craft feared to sail so far
away from fortified ports, lest some of the fast auxiliary
cruisers of Uncle Sam, on the eager lookout for prizes,
gobble them up.</p>

<p>As they sighted land, Roderic could hardly conceal his
impatience.</p>

<p>Was the Sterling Castle in port?</p>

<p>That would be a strange coincidence truly, and yet this
sanguine lover had the nerve to believe it might be true.</p>

<p>Upon some men fortune showers favors so readily that
they become rank optimists, and expect astonishing results
from the most scanty scattering of seed.</p>

<p>Indeed, chance plays quite a part in their calculations.</p>

<p>The day was almost at its close when they drew near
the islands.</p>

<p>With the rosy bloom of the setting sun shining upon
their green slopes, the picture was one calculated to strike
the eye as remarkably fine.</p>

<p>Especially would this be the case with an ocean traveler
who for some days had looked upon nothing but a watery
waste&mdash;the green trees and grass appeal to his heart.
This is always the case after a voyage&mdash;land looks doubly
inviting when necessity or desire for a change has taken
us away from friendly shores.</p>

<p>The night fell before they drew close enough to port to
give Roderic the opportunity of finding out whether the
steamer he sought was among those anchored in the little
bay.</p>

<p>Which was a keen disappointment to him.</p>

<p>As an ardent lover much allowance can be given so
good a fellow.</p>

<p>Cleo was almost as eager&mdash;she felt a warm desire to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
look upon her successful rival face to face. There was
no mean design in this, no hope of being able to find fault,
or discover that Roderic had made a wretched choice.</p>

<p>She realized how furiously in love with the girl from
Porto Rico this cousin of hers was, and since she had
been unable to arouse such a passion within his breast,
naturally she experienced a genuine desire to look upon
the lovely being who had awakened the sacred fire in his
bachelor heart.</p>

<p>Then again, Cleo was honest in her expressed desire to
be friendly with one whom fortune seemed destined to
make her cousin.</p>

<p>Glasses were of little avail, since night's shadows had
begun to fall.</p>

<p>It would not be dark, since a young July moon still held
forth after a fashion, to show them the way into port.</p>

<p>A peculiar uneasiness had possessed Roderic.</p>

<p>It dated from the conclusion of the blow.</p>

<p>Somehow, when looking upon the last most violent efforts
of the miniature hurricane, the thought had occurred
to him, what of the Sterling Castle?</p>

<p>Was she also exposed to this storm?</p>

<p>The chances seemed to favor such a conclusion.</p>

<p>He began to make new inquiries concerning her sea
worthiness.</p>

<p>Was her crew English or Spanish?</p>

<p>If the latter he had grave doubts.</p>

<p>Captain Beven was able to give him some information
that eased his mind.</p>

<p>The steamer while mature in years was not an old hulk,
by any means&mdash;Beven had himself once served on her as
second officer during a voyage to Singapore, and he had
reason to commend her seaworthy qualities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>As to her present outfit he believed it was mostly English
and Swedes, though there might be a few Spanish
among them.</p>

<p>The captain was an ancient tar, a dare devil who had
seen service all over the earth, been engaged in South
American naval wars, was with China in her conflict
against Japan, and bore the scars of a dozen wounds.</p>

<p>Such a man, afraid of nothing on earth, made an ideal
blockade runner.</p>

<p>The bold Yankees would find that they did not quite
monopolize all the valor on earth with their Hobsons and
Deweys.</p>

<p>There were others, of the same strain and speech, whom
no danger could daunt.</p>

<p>This was Captain Beven's tribute to the commander of
the blockade runner.</p>

<p>Roderic was not sorry to hear it, since <em>she</em> would be
safer in the charge of such a wonderful seaman.</p>

<p>He went down to dinner in this state of anxiety, but
under the lively sallies of his cousin soon recovered his
usual good spirits. Cleo could arouse him more quickly
than any one else he knew&mdash;she seemed to appeal to some
chord in his composition which responded just as the harp
does to the touch of the musician. When they came on
deck again after dinner, the little steam yacht was just
entering the harbor.</p>

<p>Captain Beven, knowing how fond the Portuguese are
of ceremony and display, fired his little cannon in salute
as they passed the picturesque old fort and castle guarding
the bay, and after a little delay, quite excusable with the
Portuguese gunners, an answering salvo came from the
frowning battlements that, seen in daylight were probably
not one quarter as dangerous looking as they appeared
under the tender light of the young moon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>They found an anchorage among other shipping, where
they could swing at anchor.</p>

<p>At the most only a short stop was intended here.</p>

<p>They would take on board fresh water, some fruits and
vegetables, together with chickens and eggs.</p>

<p>During the few hours in the morning while this was
being done, Roderic and his cousin expected to go ashore
and see what the place of which they had frequently heard
yet never seen, looked like.</p>

<p>They could easily give a guess.</p>

<p>There is a striking similarity among all ports under
Spanish and Portuguese flags.</p>

<p>The picturesque struggles with disorder&mdash;from a little
distance the view is entrancing, but familiarity breeds contempt.</p>

<p>Especially is this true with the rank odors that usually
predominate.</p>

<p>With twinkling lights on shore, a balmy breeze fanning
their cheeks, and the odor of flowers wafted over the
water, it was very romantic to stand upon the deck of the
yacht, anchored in still waters, after having passed so many
days upon the heaving deep.</p>

<p>Nor was there any lack of sound.</p>

<p>Men's voices floated over the water, laughter was heard
from parties of pleasure seekers in small boats, and from
various quarters came the sound of music.</p>

<p>Sweet indeed do the notes of mandolin or guitar sound
when mellowed by the water&mdash;there is a peculiar richness
and sympathy to the strumming of the taut strings that
cannot be produced under other conditions.</p>

<p>Besides, the poetry of the thing appeals to what is romantic
in the heart.</p>

<p>Lovers delight to glide upon the moonlit water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>No wonder then that Venice with her canals and gondolas
should be classed as a veritable Paradise for such
devoted people.</p>

<p>Roderic smoked his last cigar strong in the hope of replenishing
his stock on the morrow.</p>

<p>A band situated upon some open plaza discoursed military
music, and at that distance even carping critics found
little fault.</p>

<p>The evening was gliding away.</p>

<p>It passed with leaden wings to Roderic, whose ardent
spirit longed for the first streak of dawn, in the anticipation
of being able to discover whether or not the vessel
that bore Georgia was in the harbor.</p>

<p>There was something almost unendurable in the suspense,
and it required considerable determination to crush
down the spirit that demanded some immediate action on
his part.</p>

<p>He had been compelled to go back to the comforts of
his more plebeian pipe, nor did its solace fail to soothe his
troubled spirit.</p>

<p>Thus time slipped away.</p>

<p>Four bells had struck.</p>

<p>Ere long they would be thinking of seeking their
berths, and for one Roderic confessed that the summons
would not come amiss.</p>

<p>He yawned several times as though he had not yet been
able to make up the sleep lost while they were in the grasp
of the storm, when all hands found it impossible to remain
in their bunks.</p>

<p>Truth to tell he was thinking that sleep would bridge
over the time until dawn, and cause him to forget his
anxieties.</p>

<p>The lights still glimmered, nor had the sounds of music
and revelry abated one particle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>Night to the average Spanish mind means a period for
chasing dull care away in music, the dance and carousal.</p>

<p>While Roderic sat thus, his thoughts flitting from one
subject to another, since no one had spoken for quite some
time, a figure approached which he recognized upon
glancing up as belonging to Captain Beven.</p>

<p>As the mariner stooped over him he electrified Owen
with the few words he softly uttered.</p>

<p>"Sir, I have reason to believe the steamer Sterling Castle
lies at anchor just off our port quarter!"</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><a name="Chapter_XI" id="Chapter_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI.<br />

<small>THE LADY ON THE QUARTER DECK.</small></h2>


<p>The news which Captain Beven communicated almost
in a whisper to Roderic had as startling an effect upon
that gentleman as though the guns of the battery that
frowned upon their anchorage had suddenly and without
the least warning opened full upon their jaunty craft.</p>

<p>He sprang to his feet as though urged by a shock from
a concealed galvanic battery.</p>

<p>Instantly he remembered that Cleo had been close by a
short time before, and his first act was to turn his head
and look for her.</p>

<p>The ladies had however quietly withdrawn, doubtless
finding Roderic very unsociable, and leaving him to the
solace of his old pipe.</p>

<p>Which was a very sensible thing for them to do, considering
his rudeness, he concluded.</p>

<p>At any rate it left the coast clear, and all minor things
had to give way when this major passion that filled his
heart, was concerned.</p>

<p>"That is what I have been waiting to hear, Captain.
Show me the boat you mean?" he said, as quietly as the
bounding of blood through his veins would allow.</p>

<p>"Step this way, sir."</p>

<p>Captain Beven knew <em>why</em> Roderic was so deeply interested
in the Sterling Castle, and as a man who had a family
at home in some quiet little English cathedral town he
could respect these feelings of the ardent lover.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>All the world feels an interest in the course of true love,
and every decent man stands ready to lend a hand if by so
doing he may assist in the anticipated happy outcome.</p>

<p>In another minute they were leaning over the port quarter.</p>

<p>"Yonder she lies, riding at anchor. The light is very
dim, for the moon you see sir, is just about going down,
and presently we will be in the dark," said the man of
navigation.</p>

<p>Roderic glued his eyes on the indistinct form of what
appeared to be a steamer, but beyond this fact he was
unable to hazard a guess.</p>

<p>"I see her plainly enough, but what makes you imagine
or believe she may be the vessel I am so anxious about?"
he asked.</p>

<p>Captain Beven was not at all offended.</p>

<p>He knew Roderic had no idea of questioning his ability
to determine such matters, but was only curious to hear
the clinching of the argument by such means as he might
advance.</p>

<p>Hence, he made answer in the way Roderic most desired,
laying down the logic of events in quick succession.</p>

<p>Beven, if he had any peculiarity, was rather inclined to
speaking rapidly, and without any useless flow of language.</p>

<p>Like Grant and other great men of like calibre, of whom
history is full, he believed in getting at the kernel of matters
in the least possible stretch of time.</p>

<p>"Something familiar about her appearance, even seen
under such disadvantages. Never forget the cut of a boat
on which I have sailed. Then I heard her bell sound&mdash;do
you know, there are bells and bells&mdash;some have a peculiar
ring that you would recognize if you heard it on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
camel in Egypt. The Sterling Castle had such a bell&mdash;I
never heard one just like it until a short bit ago when it
sounded four strokes. I tell you sir, it made me jump and
rub my eyes, half believing I was officer of the deck again
on board the stanch old Sterling Castle. And last but
not least, there came a man from the shore rowing past
and heading for some German ship over yonder. I hailed
him, and as he came alongside asked him the question.
As near as I could make out he said he believed she was
called the Sherwin Castle, and had just arrived two hours
before sundown. That settled it, sir."</p>

<p>"I should think it did, captain. And so that is the boat.
So near and yet so far. It is very aggravating, captain."</p>

<p>"Very, sir," solemnly.</p>

<p>"I have half a notion&mdash;" reflectively.</p>

<p>"Thought you'd say that, sir," rubbing his hands gleefully,
as though anticipating something.</p>

<p>"To make a little run across to her."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, with what object in view?"</p>

<p>"Oh! merely to ease my mind with respect to her identity,
you might say," carelessly.</p>

<p>"Of course&mdash;quite natural&mdash;young blood&mdash;always impetuous,"
commented the Benedict.</p>

<p>"And incidentally to see whether I could find some
golden opportunity to have a few words with one who is a
passenger on board."</p>

<p>"Ah! yes."</p>

<p>The captain placed one finger alongside his nose.</p>

<p>It was a habit he had when engaged in serious consideration,
and Roderic, who had studied the old sea dog
to advantage, felt sure there would be some result to this
incubation.</p>

<p>Nor was he wrong in his surmise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, it could be done, sir," he said.</p>

<p>"I knew I could trust you to help me out, Heaven bless
you, old chap," said Owen, at once diving for the captain's
hand and wringing it with impetuous ardor quite
unlike his usual self possessed manner; but Cupid has
wrought more marvelous changes than this in men.</p>

<p>"It would not do to go prowling around the craft at
this hour of the night&mdash;we might be suspected of being
Yankee spies and fired upon."</p>

<p>"That is true," assented Owen, knowing full well the
captain would not stop there.</p>

<p>"Now, I know Captain Shackelford well, and it wouldn't
be strange for me to run over to shake hands with the old
war dog. Besides, a sailor has respect for another man's
affection regarding a craft he has made several voyages
on, and he'd understand why I want to tread the deck
of the Castle once again. It revives recollections, you
know, and throws a man back years."</p>

<p>"Just so," commented Roderic, encouragingly.</p>

<p>"Well, so far, good. Now, if so be you could change
your looks a little bit&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Roderic laughed exultantly.</p>

<p>"I might row you over and go aboard."</p>

<p>"Consider it done, Captain, and many thanks to you."</p>

<p>"Don't forget they owe you no good will."</p>

<p>"And would be only too glad to hang me up to the
yardarm if discovered. Don't worry, my dear fellow.
It has been my business to hide my identity from all sorts
of inquisitive people. This comes right in my line. When
will you go?"</p>

<p>"I can be ready in five minutes, sir, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"In five minutes I shall be here."</p>

<p>Then he vanished.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>The captain chuckled so hard he shook like a pyramid
of calves foot jelly.</p>

<p>"A boy after my own heart, God bless him, and all
them that loves the ladies, are my sentiments. My little
woman at home came without any such hardships, but I
honors them as think no danger too great, no price too
dear, when true affection calls. Only I <em>am</em> surprised at
his not falling in love with Miss Fairfax, for unless my
old eyes deceive me she worships the ground he walks
on. Well, this is a queer world anyhow, and remarkable
things happen in it," with which sage remark the old
sailor hurried away to fix up a little for his late visit on
board the neighboring craft.</p>

<p>When he returned to the spot the five minutes had
expired.</p>

<p>Roderic awaited him.</p>

<p>The captain would never have suspected his identity
only that he spoke.</p>

<p>In that brief space of time Roderic had completely altered
his appearance&mdash;instead of a gentleman, well dressed
and desirous of only killing time, he had the look of an
ordinary everyday sailor.</p>

<p>Even his face was altered&mdash;Captain Beven never could
tell how it was done, and marveled greatly at the tricks
of the trade&mdash;but in the semi darkness it did not look at
all like Owen who addressed him laughingly asking if he
would do.</p>

<p>"Most excellently. By the way I believe in being prepared
for emergencies, even while not in the least expecting
a display of force," significantly.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's all right," returned Owen, touching his
pocket in a convincing manner.</p>

<p>The captain laughed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>"Very good. Now, I'll take a couple of men with us to
do the rowing. They shall remain in the boat while we
go aboard. You can act like my boatswain, if you choose.
I know the men to select, smart fellows who will understand
what we're up to, and I'll guarantee they'll not give
the game away. Wait a minute."</p>

<p>The preliminaries were quickly adjusted.</p>

<p>A boat being lowered they dropped in.</p>

<p>The two men knew who their stranger sailor companion
was, the captain having given them a few pointers,
deeming it the part of wisdom that they should not be
kept in ignorance, and as Roderic had quickly made firm
friends of all the yacht's crew, by his cheery and hearty
ways, they were genuinely interested in the successful outcome
of his venture.</p>

<p>Poor the sailor who has not sweetheart or wife in port&mdash;indeed,
they have been often accused, doubtless falsely,
of a <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'predeliction'">predilection</ins> for having a girl in every port.</p>

<p>The silvery crescent moon just hung trembling above the
horizon, preparatory to taking the plunge that would hide
her from view until another night rolled around.</p>

<p>Roderic was duly impressed with the witchery of his
surroundings, nor did the romantic nature of his own
errand fail to stamp itself upon his mind.</p>

<p>Thus they quitted the side of the yacht and headed
directly for the steamer whose vague outlines could
just be dimly seen through the haze and darkness.</p>

<p>Hardly had they proceeded five boatlengths than Captain
Beven who sat beside him in the stern-sheets, turning
his head to take a last loving glance at his own little craft,
uttered an exclamation.</p>

<p>This of course caused Roderic to follow suit.</p>

<p>He saw instantly what had caught the old sailor's eye.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>A woman's white duck dress stirred by the night breeze
drew his attention to the quarter deck.</p>

<p>It was Cleo, who had come on deck again, possibly to
discover whether he had aroused from his state of dreamy
forgetfulness.</p>

<p>Did she know where they were going&mdash;was she aware
of his presence in the boat?</p>

<p>Impossible.</p>

<p>He might have called out, but that would hardly have
been politic&mdash;she should hear the results of the adventure
when they returned.</p>

<p>His attention was now entirely occupied with the craft
which their boat, urged on by the strokes of the two men,
was rapidly approaching.</p>

<p>As she loomed out of the water, even Roderic could
see she was fairly well laden.</p>

<p>He could imagine the cargo would be one that might
prove of great value to the forces of General Blanco,
could it be landed at Havana in spite of the Yankee fleet
lying off that city.</p>

<p>When they came close up Roderic saw the British flag
floating from the stern.</p>

<p>Then his eyes sought the smoke stack, and as near as
he could judge in the uncertain light it appeared to answer
the description he had received of the Sterling Castle&mdash;the
funnel was dark below and light above, probably
buff, with the trade-mark of its line in relief.</p>

<p>It mattered little, since Captain Beven was about to
settle this matter once and for all.</p>

<p>Their approach had been noisy enough to attract attention,
and as they came up, a deep voice hailed them.</p>

<p>It was a decidedly English voice, and the salutation
lacked the extreme courtesy that might have been expected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
had the vessel floated the colors of Spain, France
or Italy.</p>

<p>"Hello! the boat&mdash;what d'ye want?"</p>

<p>That was to the point, at least.</p>

<p>Captain Beven made immediate answer to the effect
that it was his desire to come aboard and pay his respects
to his old friend the skipper, upon hearing which the
man who had hailed from the deck sang out his readiness
to receive them.</p>

<p>It may be readily understood that Roderic found himself
alongside the blockade runner with singular emotions
stirring within his mind.</p>

<p>The remarkable had happened again, for it was quite
out of the common that the two vessels thus came together
in the Azores.</p>

<p>She was aboard this craft, the girl for whom his soul
yearned.</p>

<p>Perhaps he would even see her ere the lapse of many
minutes.</p>

<p>What bliss in the very thought&mdash;how could he help it
if his traitor heart bounded tumultuously within its narrow
confines?</p>

<p>Still, he could not count upon it, since "there is many
a slip twixt cup and lip."</p>

<p>Perhaps she may have already retired for the night,
since the hour was wearing late.</p>

<p>This hardly struck him as possible, for after the storm,
and the necessity of being confined to the cabin, doubtless
the senorita would be only too glad to pass hours on deck,
especially when the night was so warm below.</p>

<p>Other things might also influence her.</p>

<p>The sounds coming over the water, how vividly they
must remind her of dear San Juan, and after an enforced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
exile from her native city it would be a pleasure to once
more sit and drink in the music and laughter and song
that can always be heard in a Spanish or Portuguese town
after the heat of day has given place to the cool of evening.</p>

<p>Captain Beven clambered aboard and as though he had
already received his orders to do likewise, Roderic followed
suit.</p>

<p>A number of English sailors stood around as if in
curiosity.</p>

<p>The captain had followed the second officer in the direction
of the cabin, and Roderic moved in the same
quarter, as though possessed of some curiosity regarding
the vessel upon which his feet now pressed for the first
time.</p>

<p>By degrees he thus shook off the inquisitive sailormen
who had first kept an eye on him.</p>

<p>All the while he was getting closer to the quarter deck,
knowing that here if anywhere, he would be apt to find
the object of his search.</p>

<p>Beven had arranged for at least an hour's stay on
board, so there would be plenty of time to accomplish
what he wished.</p>

<p>When he heard the voice of Georgia near by it sent
a thrill through his heart.</p>

<p>She was here within a dozen yards of him, this beautiful
maid of San Juan whose presence affected him so
strangely, and under whose potent spell his heart delighted
to remain a prisoner, rescue or no rescue.</p>

<p>How was he to find an opportunity to address her with
others near by?</p>

<p>That must depend upon the good fortune that awaits
upon Cupid's devotees&mdash;and Captain Beven, who might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
be trusted to put in a few good strokes in order to favor
his protege.</p>

<p>As Roderic slipped closer up to the little ladder that
led to the quarter deck he could plainly discover that
besides General Porfidio there were two gentlemen present
on the ground, and these he presently made out to
be the redoubtable Jerome Wellington and a Spanish
agent, possibly the same Senor Roblado, who had shown
such a valiant spirit at the bungalow on the Rathmines
road, Dublin.</p>

<p>Roderic was so eager to approach the girl that he could
with a clear conscience have tossed both of these loquacious
worthies overboard into the waters of the harbor,
had he been allowed the chance, and could this bold move
have secured the desired private interview.</p>

<p>He knew it would not&mdash;that he must possess his soul in
patience and await the logic of events.</p>

<p>Don Porfidio was holding forth upon some favorite
topic, and his gruff voice sounded like the distant boom
of breakers on a lee shore.</p>

<p>Roderic bore no animosity toward the veteran&mdash;indeed,
he had rather grown fond of him in times past, and
the fact that he was of kin to Georgia added something
to this feeling.</p>

<p>At the same time he wished the big senor anywhere
else than here just at present.</p>

<p>There is such a thing as being in the way&mdash;at times
even three can make a crowd.</p>

<p>You see, Roderic was no different from the same old
general run of lovers&mdash;every man must be a law unto
himself when he finds circumstances surrounding him
with a network of this kind.</p>

<p>He bided his time and counted the minutes as though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
they were freighted with lead, hoping that the gentlemen
might suddenly be assailed by a most amazing thirst that
would demand their presence below decks.</p>

<p>Such a thing was apt to happen at any time where Don
Porfidio was concerned, as Roderic knew full well from
previous experience.</p>

<p>Ah! some one approached.</p>

<p>With his heart beating like a trip hammer from mingled
eagerness and anticipation, he slunk back out of sight and
waited, hoping that this might be the earnestly hoped
for deliverance.</p>

<p>It was.</p>

<p>Captain Beven had done his part well.</p>

<p>The second officer of the blockade runner appeared on
the quarter deck with his usual bluff announcement.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen all, the captain has a visitor who desires to
make your acquaintance in the cabin. He has brought
over a basket of champagne with which to drink in memory
of old days when he trod this deck in the duties that
I now perform. Gentlemen all, will you be pleased to
accompany me?"</p>

<p>Would they&mdash;Roderic could not but chuckle at the
eager haste with which they bounded from their chairs,
and apologizing to the lady for this necessity that tore
them from her charming company, came down the ladder
one after the other, to solemnly march toward the cabin.</p>

<p>The game had worked.</p>

<p>Roderic now had the coast clear and it would be his
own fault if he failed to improve the golden opportunity
a happy fortune had placed before him.</p>

<small>THE MAN WHO MADE SIGNS.</small></h2>


<p>It was no time for delay.</p>

<p>Enough precious minutes had been already wasted
while he listened to the remarks of the trio upon the
upper deck.</p>

<p>Georgia had made some laughing remark at the haste
shown in their departure&mdash;she knew the weakness of
Don Porfidio, and rallied them on their readiness to seek
the confines of the stuffy cabin because forsooth a gentleman
had come on board with a basket of champagne.</p>

<p>Perhaps, woman like, she was a little piqued because
they beat such a hasty retreat.</p>

<p>Well, there was one ascending the ladder at this very
moment whom a thousand baskets, each loaded to the
brim with the finest of Mumms' Extra Dry could not
tempt from the locality which she graced with her charming
presence.</p>

<p>Roderic mounted eagerly.</p>

<p>Yes, the coast was clear.</p>

<p>The young girl sat quite alone, apparently lost in deep
thought.</p>

<p>Around her were several steamer chairs, just as the
gallant trio had left them when they made their hasty
escape.</p>

<p>Roderic's eyes were glued on the girl.</p>

<p>She had one hand up to her head&mdash;her rounded cheek
was poised upon the forefinger, and in the ravished eyes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
of this enthusiastic adorer she made the most charming
spectacle on earth.</p>

<p>He drew near, endeavoring to calm the tumultuous
throbbing of his heart.</p>

<p>Heaven was kind to allow him such an opportunity,
so much more than he had expected or even hoped for
in his wildest fancies.</p>

<p>Now he stood behind her&mdash;not more than three feet
separated them.</p>

<p>It was a moment of intense suspense, since Roderic
hardly knew how he should make his presence known
without alarming the girl, and besides, wished to become
entirely calm ere trusting himself to speak.</p>

<p>She evidently heard the slight movement he made&mdash;at
least she seemed to be aware of his presence, for while
she did not move she presently spoke.</p>

<p>"Well, you have returned?"</p>

<p>No answer.</p>

<p>"I said you had evidently come back, sir."</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Roderic, weakly.</p>

<p>"I don't understand why you should," she said, a little
scornfully.</p>

<p>Roderic hardly knew himself, save that somehow for
the life of him he could not help it&mdash;there was an attraction
in her presence that it was utterly useless to resist.</p>

<p>"Nor I," he muttered in reply.</p>

<p>"Indeed, that is singular. I am sure I can spare your
presence when there is a far greater attraction in the
captain's chart room. Pray, do not deprive yourself of
such enchanting society because I shall be left alone. I
have quite consoling company in my thoughts of those
far away. Leave me, therefore, I beg."</p>

<p>Then it dawned upon the benighted man that this little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
witch had been addressing him under the positive belief
that it was one of the gentlemen who had made such a
mad bolt for the cabin.</p>

<p>Her words too gave him a delicious satisfaction&mdash;could
she refer to him especially when she thus spoke
of those to whom her mind wandered with pleasure&mdash;those
who were supposed to be separated by many leagues
of water?</p>

<p>At any rate he hugged the sweet delusion to his heart&mdash;these
lovers are voraciously selfish.</p>

<p>"Why don't you say something&mdash;have you lost your
tongue, <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">amigo?</i>" she demanded.</p>

<p>He still hesitated, and overcome by the temptation of
her dear presence put out a trembling hand and touched
her raven hair.</p>

<p>At this the girl suddenly roused herself and as she
turned her head quickly Roderic found himself looking
into those wonderful orbs that long ago had so riddled
his wretched heart that it might have done duty as a
housewife's sieve.</p>

<p>They were filled with astonishment at first, then indignation
and gathering anger, for this girl of the South
had a temper.</p>

<p>"How <em>dare</em> you touch me?"</p>

<p>Roderic made a mute appeal, this time with both hands&mdash;while
she was talking with gathering emphasis, and
really allowing him no opportunity to open with an explanation,
he was thus going through a series of remarkable
gesticulations that would have certainly amused an
outside spectator could he have seen them.</p>

<p>Even Georgia became conscious that the strange sailor
man was endeavoring to prove his devotion&mdash;he clasped
his hands and wrung them, he held out his arms, entreatingly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
he pressed one hand over his heart as he sank on
his knee, holding the other as might a princely beggar soliciting
alms.</p>

<p>All of which at length aroused her feminine curiosity,
and she ceased scolding him for his apparent impudence,
to demand wonderingly:</p>

<p>"Are you mute&mdash;have you lost your tongue&mdash;why
don't you answer and tell me who are you and what in
the name of the Virgin do you mean by such operatic
gestures?"</p>

<p>His chance had come at last.</p>

<p>"I want&mdash;<em>you!</em>" he managed to say, nor was he able to
recognize his own voice.</p>

<p>"Indeed, you are modesty personified; but I must tell
you, Master Impudence, that you cannot have <em>me</em>, and
that unless you return instantly to the quarter where
you belong I shall signal to the cabin and summon assistance.
Instantly, do you understand, sirrah?" and she
emphasized the command with an imperious little stamp of
her foot upon the deck, that would have done credit,
Roderic thought, to a queen.</p>

<p>"Yes, I understand," he said, his voice growing bolder
as he began to use it.</p>

<p>"Then why do you not obey me?" she asked, as if
surprised at the density of his intellect.</p>

<p>"Because I am bound in chains&mdash;because I live only in
your presence&mdash;because it would require more resolution
than I possess to voluntarily quit your presence," he
declared, warmly.</p>

<p>Roderic was himself again, evidently&mdash;at least he had
whipped his demoralized faculties into line and found
his tongue, so that he might give expression to what was
in his heart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>The effect upon the young woman was plainly perceptible&mdash;she
seemed overwhelmed either by the warmth
of the sentiments he expressed or some familiar tone in
his ardent voice, possibly both.</p>

<p>At any rate she no longer threatened to summon assistance
from the cabin of the steamer.</p>

<p>On the contrary she advanced a step nearer the supposed
sailor, and slowly, wonderingly stretched out an
eager hand toward his arm, her eyes all the while fastened
upon his dimly seen face as though she would there discover
his secret.</p>

<p>"Who&mdash;who are you&mdash;what right have you to express
such sentiments toward me?" she asked, in a trembling
voice.</p>

<p>Roderic had now grown quite bold.</p>

<p>"By the right you gave me&mdash;by the love that has sent
me aboard this hostile craft just to get one glimpse of
your sweet face, to hear your dearly loved voice, perhaps
if Heaven were very very kind, to even touch your hand
reverently with mine. Do you longer question my right?"</p>

<p>"Sancta Maria! it is he, my Roderic!"</p>

<p>She held out both hands eagerly and he crushed them
within his own.</p>

<p>What would he not have given for the privilege of taking
her wholly within the shelter of his arms, and pressing
her to his loving heart.</p>

<p>But such action might be seen&mdash;they were in a position
where their figures would be outlined in silhouette against
the sky, should any of those upon the lower deck chance
to look that way.</p>

<p>Hence, the lover was forced to be content to press the
two hands thus confided to his trust, though he did manage
to bend his head and press a burning kiss upon each
in turn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>"What wonderful mystery is this&mdash;why are you here
in this deep disguise? They told me the Azores were
islands of enchantment and surely I am beginning to believe
it," she said, her voice thrilling with excitement.</p>

<p>"It is very simple, and I shall quickly explain. But,
dearest senorita, do not forget that I am in the enemy's
stronghold. If caught death might be the price of my
daring."</p>

<p>Then he proceeded to elucidate.</p>

<p>It was very natural, after all.</p>

<p>She blushed and thrilled with pleasure to know that
she still held this man's heart in the hollow of her hand&mdash;that
he had dared all in the mad desire to once again
see her face to face.</p>

<p>That was a keen satisfaction to one who loved with
every fibre of her being.</p>

<p>Besides, there was a strong touch of the romantic in
his strange appearance, that was not without its effect
upon Georgia&mdash;native of Porto Rico, with some of Spain's
most aristocratic blood in her veins, it was not at all
singular that such a deed, savoring of the days of chivalry
when Knights sought peril for the sake of Love, should
appeal irresistibly to her heart.</p>

<p>She had cherished the memory of how he rushed into
danger in Dublin, impelled by this same magical motive
power, and the thought of his daring had been very
sweet to her when seated alone upon the deck of the
steamer watching the rolling billows, or resting in her
bijou berth below.</p>

<p>No longer could she doubt the ardor of his love, when
he showed such a willingness to risk life in order to prove
it.</p>

<p>So Roderic related the little run of adventure that had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
befallen him since last they parted in the dark at the
time he emerged from the cellar of the queer bungalow
dwelling.</p>

<p>It was not much, but as she had experienced the same
storm there was at least a bond of sympathy between
them.</p>

<p>All the while she maintained a nervous watch in the
direction of the steep stair leading up from the lower
deck.</p>

<p>He knew why she exhibited this zeal, and felt flattered.</p>

<p>It puffs a man up to realize that he is an indispensable
condition to one woman on earth&mdash;that she is deeply
concerned about his well being; and when Roderic knew
the peril hanging over him caused Georgia such constant
uneasiness he gloried in the fact, simply because it spoke
eloquently of her abiding affection.</p>

<p>"I fancy Captain Beven will keep the gallant gentlemen
enjoying themselves for some little time yet. He is
a capital hand at a yarn, and with a box of prime Havanas
which he says he secured from a trader who came out to
our boat, to back up the basket of champagne Cleo sent
aboard, I imagine he will hold them spellbound until the
last cork is popped and the balance of the weeds sacrificed
to the god, Moloch."</p>

<p>He knew from the uneasy movement of the girl that
he had said something to arouse a new train of thought
in her mind.</p>

<p>"Cleo&mdash;she is on yonder boat which I can see through
the darkness&mdash;your cousin Cleo. And after having passed
days in her society, how do you find your heart, Senor
Roderic&mdash;has she still failed to creep in?" she asked, with
a peculiar quivering spasm of pain in her voice.</p>

<p>"My God, Georgia, how can I make you believe I love,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
can love no woman on earth while you live? Is not my
presence here at this moment proof sufficient? You fill
my heart to absolute completion, so there in no room for
another. Will you believe that I live and breathe and
have my very being centered on <em>you</em>, heart of my heart
and soul of my soul?"</p>

<p>These words, spoken in a low but tense tone, seemed to
persuade her&mdash;the magnetism of his presence, the beloved
tones of his voice, the very fervor of his impassioned
gaze all served to convince the senorita that this man
whose love had once been sufficient to kindle the fires of
jealousy in his breast, was incapable of deception.</p>

<p>"I <em>do</em> believe&mdash;yes, I trust all my hopes of future happiness
in your hands, for oh! Roderic if your love ever
fails me, if it fades away like a dream, I shall surely die,"
she made response.</p>

<p>Of course he felt it his privilege and duty to swear by
everything he held sacred, by the graves of his ancestors,
after the Japanese fashion, that so long as earth held them
both, he could neither change nor his passion grow cold.</p>

<p>And she believed him from that hour; implicit confidence
dwelt within her trusting heart, and if this man
ever did aught to destroy the faith she placed in his affection
let him be accused from that day.</p>

<p>This was what Roderic was telling himself as he stood
there holding her hand, the magnetic spark flowing from
soul to soul.</p>

<p>He was ordinarily quite a matter of fact man, but even
the most prosaic can be counted on to give way to unheard
of romantic tendencies under the spur of such conditions.</p>

<p>Time flies with extraordinary swiftness when the moments
are freighted with ecstatic bliss.</p>

<p>Roderic endeavored to keep his wits about him even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
while exchanging these sentiments with the girl of his
heart.</p>

<p>He knew he had enemies near&mdash;he had not forgotten
the bitterness with which Jerome hated him and the
ardor with which the Spanish plotters would have sacrificed
him when he was held a prisoner in the Dublin
villa.</p>

<p>It would be a decidedly unpleasant episode in his
checkered career should they capture him on board the
Sterling Castle&mdash;he was a marked man in the minds of
those whose sympathies were enlisted for Spain, and they
could imagine nothing finer than an opportunity to lay
him by the heels.</p>

<p>Georgia too was on the watch for danger, since any
injury to her lover must cause suffering in her own devoted
heart.</p>

<p>She imagined the three brave gentlemen when they returned
after finishing the wine and cigars would come
as they went, in a bunch.</p>

<p>If this were the case she would receive ample warning
of their approach&mdash;when the voice of the siren was heard
rumbling afar it would be time for Roderic to say good
bye, and to get down from that quarter deck with all due
alacrity.</p>

<p>A chance was given them to speak of the future in the
land where fate was taking them as fast as steam could
drive, and Roderic improved the opportunity to arrange it
so that he might be sure of meeting Georgia should fortune
allow him to enter San Juan ere it was surrendered
to General Miles or those under him.</p>

<p>It looked rosy enough just then while her loved presence
beamed upon him&mdash;perhaps later on, with lowering
clouds of misfortune shrouding his future, Roderic might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
have cause for doubts and fears that it would require
all his personal valor to scatter.</p>

<p>The warning she counted on failed them, for Don Porfidio
knew better than most men when he had discovered
a good thing, and could not be prevailed upon to leave
it short of an earthquake or a simoon.</p>

<p>Thus it chanced that Jerome returned alone, returned
smoking a prime weed, and possibly filled with the thought
of a quiet little flirtation with the general's charming
niece, whose cold treatment of his Beau Brummel advances
had rather piqued his spirit of romantic interest,
and aroused his manly desire for conquest&mdash;returned so
quietly that his approach was quite unobserved by the
two lovers among the steamer chairs on the quarter deck
until his head and shoulders loomed dimly into view above
the top of the short ladder.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><a name="Chapter_XIII" id="Chapter_XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII.<br />

<small>ADONIS ON A NEW TACK.</small></h2>


<p>Ordinarily it took considerable to surprise Jerome
Wellington&mdash;he had such good control over his nervous
system that he could take in a philosophical manner much
that might have rattled a less collected customer.</p>

<p>In plainer words he had studied the art of appearing
cool under all conditions.</p>

<p>As an adventurer with an enviable record for successful
achievements behind him he had many times found
this accomplishment very useful in carrying out the bold
designs necessary to the fulfillment of his game.</p>

<p>For once at least Jerome was obliged to confess to weakening&mdash;for
once his confidence appeared to have overshot
its mark, and he even doubted the positive evidence of
his senses.</p>

<p>He could have sworn that, as his head arose above the
level of the quarter deck he positively saw a common
fellow in the dress of a sailor, standing very very close
to the beautiful niece of General Porfidio&mdash;more than
this, that he actually had the audacity to raise her hand
to his lips and kiss it&mdash;Jerome knew full well what a
kiss was like, and could not be deceived in the sound of
one, even when simply pressed upon a lady's hand.</p>

<p>Indignation filled his noble breast.</p>

<p>Since Don Porfidio, gallant son of Porto Rico, was
absent from his post of duty, the pleasant task of defending
his ward must fall to others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>Undoubtedly this fellow must have used some ignoble
means of gaining the mastery over the young and innocent
girl's mind&mdash;Jerome had exhausted his own matchless
resources for the last few days in the endeavor to arouse
a responsive feeling in her heart, and possibly felt considerably
piqued just now to discover that what he had
failed to accomplish this son of Neptune had apparently
brought about with ease.</p>

<p>Of course he possessed some wonderful power that
aided him in this revolutionary work&mdash;Jerome had read
and heard considerable on the subject of personal magnetism,
of hypnotism, the astonishing control one mind
may have over another that nature has so constructed
as to make it subject or tributary to the first.</p>

<p>What was needed, therefore, was the sudden introduction
of a third resolute body in order to break the magic
spell.</p>

<p>Jerome would be this public benefactor&mdash;he was always
ready to sacrifice his own comfort in order to restore
natural harmony.</p>

<p>Having thus quickly decided that it was not only his
privilege but a duty as well, to step between this necromancer
and his intended victim, Jerome set the ball rolling
by continuing his upward movement.</p>

<p>By this time his presence seemed to have become known
to those in whose mutual affairs he was taking such a remarkable
interest.</p>

<p>Strangely enough it was the girl who first detected the
fire of his cigar appearing above the line marking the
quarter deck&mdash;the girl who uttered a choking little Spanish
exclamation of mingled alarm and consternation&mdash;the
girl who even sprang back a step as though to make
it appear that she and the sailor were but engaged in an
ordinary conversation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>All of which was noted by the newcomer with no little
surprise.</p>

<p>It did not alter his determination to inject his personality
into the game.</p>

<p>As has been said before Jerome was not a coward,
whatever else he may have been.</p>

<p>True, it did not require the dashing soldierly qualities
of a D'Artagnan to advance upon a solitary sailorman
who had broken the rules of the ship and pushed his inferior
person upon the deck space reserved for superior
beings.</p>

<p>Jerome solemnly walked toward the fellow.</p>

<p>He noticed that the chap had not stirred an inch all
this while, but seemed to be awaiting his masterly approach.</p>

<p>Had the tables been turned, and he been made the subject
of the girl's mesmeric power he could not have stood
there more rigid.</p>

<p>Perhaps he meant to exercise his hypnotic powers upon
the new arrival.</p>

<p>Unconsciously Jerome braced himself against such a
dreadful influence.</p>

<p>Again, it might be fear that paralyzed the fellow&mdash;surely,
the spectacle of Jerome striding angrily forward
was enough to strike alarm at the heart of the most valiant&mdash;so
the said Jerome himself thought.</p>

<p>Such a thing as even the glimmer of the truth had not
as yet even dawned upon his benighted mind&mdash;how was
it possible, when he believed Roderic to be a thousand
miles away?</p>

<p>The situation was exceedingly dramatic when these two
men faced each other, with Georgia hovering near by,
ready to invoke the god of peace if matters grew too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
stormy, although her last effort in that line, when Don
Porfidio and Roderic crossed swords in the bungalow
had not been much of a success.</p>

<p>"Well, sir, what do you mean by breaking the rules
and thrusting your unwelcome company upon the quarter
deck? If Captain Shackelford was made aware of this
he would use the cat over your stupid shoulders, do you
hear?"</p>

<p>The sailorman answered not.</p>

<p>This increased the other's kindling passion, for he foolishly
believed his ferocious appearance had awed the man,
and that possibly he could not reply because his teeth were
rattling together like Spanish castanets.</p>

<p>He raised his voice higher.</p>

<p>"Don't imagine I didn't see what was going on. I understand
the power you have exercised over this young
lady&mdash;the miserable hypnotic influence you have exerted
to control her actions.</p>

<p>"And let me tell you, fellow, that power ends from this
moment. Acting in the place of her natural guardian,
who is unavoidably detained below just at present&mdash;serving
in his stead I, Jerome Wellington snap the chain you
have dared to throw about her sacred person. She is free
from this hour, free from your miserable, devilish power.
And as for you, fellow&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped as though not yet quite certain as to the
extreme course of punishment that by rights should be
meted out for such a condign offense.</p>

<p>"Well?" muttered the other, anxious of course to have
the agony over with and the worst known.</p>

<p>"I am inclined to amuse myself in kicking you off the
quarterdeck&mdash;perhaps it may have the effect of also
scattering some of your wonderful magnetic charms,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
since I have heard that the hypnotic power is shattered
by a shock to the seat of the nervous system."</p>

<p>These were brave words, truly, but if the man who
gave utterance to them expected the other to show any
symptom of fear, he certainly counted without his host.</p>

<p>Perhaps he imagined the alarmed sailor would put
up a plea for mercy, would even drop on his knees in
suing for pardon.</p>

<p>Such a melo-dramatic action would be a rare spectacle
for the gods&mdash;in order to appear the more heroic in the
sight of this fair girl Jerome might even have magnanimously
declined to carry on warfare when the enemy
sued for peace&mdash;he was a man who never neglected an
opportunity to pose as a magnificent figure before feminine
eyes.</p>

<p>Contrary to his expectation, however, the affair did
not take on this guise.</p>

<p>Instead of showing the white feather the enemy at
once hoisted signals of defiance.</p>

<p>He began to coolly and deliberately roll back the sleeves
of his flannel shirt.</p>

<p>The act was intended for supreme scorn&mdash;it meant that
he snapped his fingers contemptuously in the face of the
Adonis&mdash;it meant that he prepared himself in nautical
language, to "resist boarders."</p>

<p>There was trouble in prospect.</p>

<p>Jerome had gone too far to back down&mdash;he must either
put his words into execution or give evidence of cowardice.</p>

<p>The girl, seeing how matters stood, now endeavored
to prevent a rupture.</p>

<p>"Senor, this is a friend of mine, one I have known a
long time. If I choose to receive him on the quarterdeck<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
that is surely an affair to be settled with my uncle and
the captain. I will relieve you of any anxiety and responsibility,
senor," she said, with pointed emphasis.</p>

<p>"Pardon, senorita, but it has already gone too deep to be
dropped. There is an issue between this a&mdash;humble friend
of yours and myself, which can only be settled by an appeal
to arms, not to Caesar. Therefore, my fine fellow,
look you out, for I intend to toss you down where you
belong, since you have positively refused to go there voluntarily
when I gave you the chance."</p>

<p>He took a step toward Roderic, who calmly awaited
for hostilities to begin.</p>

<p>There was good reason too why the latter should have
become nervous over the matter.</p>

<p>It was at this juncture that several violent sneezes
were heard ringing over the vessel, and in this signal
Roderic recognized a part of Captain Beven's design to
warn him that he should only be able to detain the gentlemen
a few minutes longer, so that it might be essential
for the lover to make his farewells without further loss
of time, if so be he had been fortunate enough to find an
opportunity to see his charmer.</p>

<p>Roderic however, was hardly in a position to carry out
this programme.</p>

<p>Jerome showed fight, and it was really too much to
expect a man of Roderic's character to withdraw in ignominious
fashion under the very eyes he adored.</p>

<p>Plainly he was in for a miserable struggle.</p>

<p>He deplored this on several accounts, since it might
jeopardise his mission, and moreover place him in a poor
light before Georgia, for what man desires to engage in
an ordinary brawl in the presence of the being he adores.</p>

<p>There are times however when "needs must when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
devil drives," so that it was not a question of choice but
necessity with Roderic.</p>

<p>About this time the first faint suspicion broke in upon
Jerome's mind to the effect that things might be other
than they seemed.</p>

<p>He had no opportunity to gather up the fragments
and link them together in a chain that might reveal the
entire truth&mdash;some invisible power flashed a little thought
into his brain&mdash;it may have been the attitude assumed
by the sailor as though awaiting his attack, for there was
that about it suggesting the trained athlete and not an
ordinary Jack Tar, clumsy with his fists.</p>

<p>At any rate what did Jerome do as he came close up
but bend his head forward and fix his steadfast gaze upon
the other's face.</p>

<p>Roderic had deemed his disguise secure, and so it was
under all ordinary pressure.</p>

<p>It had resisted curious glances from the crew of the
blockade runner, and even Love's eyes had failed to penetrate
beneath the surface.</p>

<p>There is no sight one half so keen as that of burning
Hate, which seems capable of piercing all obstacles set
in the way.</p>

<p>So it came home to Jerome with the rapidity of the
lightning's flash, with whom he had to deal.</p>

<p>No wonder the man's attitude seemed familiar&mdash;no
wonder he dared defy attack&mdash;no wonder the lovely Porto
Rican belle called him her <em>friend!</em></p>

<p>And the sudden knowledge galled Jerome.</p>

<p>Under it he waxed wroth.</p>

<p>Baffled in his endeavor to secure Miss Fairfax and her
millions because forsooth she chose to fall in love with
this traveling agent, he was now to be beaten in his other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
little game of occupying Georgia's heart because Roderic
had centered his affection there.</p>

<p>Ye gods, it was enough to anger the coolest and most
diplomatic of men, and Jerome could not be blamed for
letting passion run away with his better judgment.</p>

<p>"So, it's <em>you?</em>" he grunted, sneeringly.</p>

<p>Roderic knew his identity was no longer a secret, and
that he might as well throw off the mask he had assumed.</p>

<p>All he desired now was to so conduct himself in <em>her</em>
presence that she might find no occasion for reproach.</p>

<p>"Yes, it's no other, Wellington. How is your health
these days?" he said, carelessly, hoping the other might
cool down and thus avoid friction, for if given his own
way Roderic would have wished to leave the steamer
peaceably, though ready to do his share in any action
that might be unwisely precipitated by a hot headed antagonist.</p>

<p>"Better than yours will be presently," was the stinging
reply from Jerome, who accompanied his words with
a grin as though in anticipation he could already see the
object of his dislike receiving punishment at the hands
of stern old Captain Shackelford, whose greatest <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'bete noir'"><i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bete
noire</i></ins> was a traitor or a spy.</p>

<p>"What may that remark mean?" asked Roderic.</p>

<p>"That you shall be denounced as a spy&mdash;that you have
crept aboard this vessel under false colors to learn her
cargo and destination in order that she could be seized
by your accursed cruisers on the blockade&mdash;that you have
spent these days to advantage in prying out these secrets
and should therefore suffer the usual fate of any common
low spy."</p>

<p>Roderic still preserved his temper&mdash;perhaps the occasion
would presently come when he could repay these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
insults with interest&mdash;it might be even closer than Jerome
suspected, but for the present his policy was to keep the
peace just so long as it could be done with honor.</p>

<p>"You seem to imagine I have been on board during
the whole voyage?" he remarked.</p>

<p>"How could it be otherwise?" demanded Jerome, looking
for some secret trap.</p>

<p>"Because as you happen to know, I was left behind in
Dublin when the Sterling Castle left the harbor at Kingstown&mdash;because
I have come on board to-night with Captain Beven,
who so royally entertained you in the cabin
just now, at the expense of myself and my Cousin Cleo,
the owner of the steam yacht Beven commands. As to my
motive in boarding your boat, I am not ashamed to admit
it to you, sir&mdash;it was to see and converse with this lady,
who holds the first place in my heart, and whom God
willing, I expect some day to claim as my wife. That is
all, sir."</p>

<p>It should have been enough.</p>

<p>Had Jerome been as sensible in this game as he had
proven himself in various others he must have realized
that this determined act of Roderic took him once and for
all out of the chase for the Fairfax millions and virtually
left the field to him.</p>

<p>But something had occurred to make a change in the
schemer's plan of campaign&mdash;he was not as hot after those
millions just now as he had been in the past.</p>

<p>Truth to tell a face had bewitched him and even the
elegant Don Juan found his Waterloo in the daughter
of Porto Rico&mdash;yes, he had to admit the stinging fact that
after playing at love all these years he was now actually
smitten.</p>

<p>"You are mistaken, Owen, that is not all. I have serious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
doubts concerning the truth of your story&mdash;I rather
imagine you are bent on killing two birds with one stone,
and intended learning all about this boat&mdash;that your seeking
an audience with the senorita"&mdash;bowing in her direction&mdash;"was
but an afterthought. However, it does not
matter. I have an unpleasant duty to perform."</p>

<p>"Indeed! What might that be?"</p>

<p>"Arresting you, and taking you before the captain
charged with being a spy."</p>

<p>"You wouldn't try that, Wellington?"</p>

<p>"Oh! I wouldn't&mdash;perhaps you doubt my ability?"</p>

<p>"I simply warn you against it. I should hate to offer
violence in the presence of a lady&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't mind me, Senor Roderic&mdash;you have my permission
to defend yourself even if by so doing you are compelled
to spoil the gentleman beau's classic features!"
cried the little senorita, ready to display her colors.</p>

<p>"That settles it&mdash;will you come with me peaceably or
forcibly?" demanded the enraged Jerome, stretching out
a powerful arm.</p>

<p>"Neither, thanks," replied Roderic, stepping back.</p>

<p>"Then here's at you for keeps," and Wellington
plunged forward with impetuous zeal.</p>

<p>Senorita Georgia had great faith in the individual
prowess of her betrothed, whom she had seen come out
victor in other affairs, yet Jerome was no stripling, and
besides, assistance for him might arrive at any moment&mdash;so
she stood behind the barricade of steamer chairs and
fervently besought the Virgin to favor the cause of the
brave man she loved.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><a name="Chapter_XIV" id="Chapter_XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV.<br />

<small>A CHASE TO THE YACHT.</small></h2>


<p>Possibly Jerome Wellington had made a study of the
tactics employed so successfully by the great and famous
general whose name he bore with so little lustre.</p>

<p>At any rate he believed in a quick and masterly attack,
whereby the enemy might be demoralized, providing said
enemy chanced to be inferior to him in power or endurance.</p>

<p>Roderic did not deceive himself with any false hope that
the game was not worth the candle, nor that his opponent
intended only a gigantic bluff. He had prepared for business,
and meant to be in the game from start to finish.</p>

<p>Besides, deep down in his heart he realized that the
handsome Adonis had been playing his cards with the idea
of centering the affections of the charming Georgia upon
himself, and this alone was a positive crime in the eyes of
the man who lived only to win her for his own.</p>

<p>That rampant spark of jealousy has much to account
for in this world&mdash;kingdoms have fallen, principalities
been sacked, and countless homes been broken up because
of it; while on the other hand it has urged men to great
and noble deeds in order to win in the game of hearts.</p>

<p>Roderic, therefore, rather enjoyed the prospect of a little
bout with this dashing cavalier whom he had once
called his friend&mdash;he believed it would do him a world of
good to embrace Jerome&mdash;he had more than once suspected
that the modern Beau Brummel was guilty of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
awful crime&mdash;in a gentleman&mdash;of wearing stays inside his
coat, so that he might appear more military in his figure;
and the opportunity was at hand to ascertain the truth.</p>

<p>Thus he stretched out his arms and took the man who
leaped forward, to his heart.</p>

<p>Such an embrace as he gave the Adonis&mdash;Georgia
thought she heard his ribs crack under the anaconda-like
strain, and his tongue certainly did protrude from between
his teeth.</p>

<p>Again Captain Beven's accommodating sneeze sounded
like a trumpet through the vessel.</p>

<p>It was the last call&mdash;the little party was in the act of
leaving the cabin&mdash;he had exhausted all his resources in
the endeavor to hold them back a while longer.</p>

<p>Roderic was hardly in a condition to carry out his part
of the programme, nor did he care very much, now that
his secret had been juggled with, and the truth must be
made known to all.</p>

<p>First Jerome should be attended to.</p>

<p>His ardor had really run away with his usual discretion&mdash;it
must be cooled off, and Roderic for one knew a
means of accomplishing the same.</p>

<p>Time was a factor in his calculations also, since at any
moment General Porfidio and the others were apt to appear
on the scene.</p>

<p>The little De Brabant had ceased uttering confused
prayers to the Virgin for her lover's safety, since he had
thus speedily reduced the blustering hero to a state of
"innocuous desuetude"&mdash;she was now more deeply concerned
in the manner whereby the said Senor Roderic was
to free himself from the incubus that held on with such a
tenacious grip.</p>

<p>"Drop him over the rail, <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">amigo</i>&mdash;a bath, give the handsome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
Adonis a bath&mdash;it will surely be good for his complexion.
The rail Senor Roderic&mdash;it is close at your hand
and <em>so</em> convenient. Besides, better such a soft fall than
broken bones on the lower deck!"</p>

<p>Thus she cried in her excitement, modulating her voice
until it was hardly more than a tense whisper.</p>

<p>And Owen knew it was not so much resentment
against Jerome for his persistent attentions as the eager
desire to serve the man she adored, that actuated her
course.</p>

<p>The voices of the gentlemen could be plainly heard as
they emerged from the chart room and sauntered toward
the side of the steamer where Beven had left his yawl&mdash;no
doubt the visitor was still cracking some of his old
chestnut jokes, for the laughter of Don Porfidio bubbled
over almost continually&mdash;besides; that champagne had
been very extra dry.</p>

<p>At any rate the suggestion advanced by Georgia coincided
with Roderic's own views on the subject.</p>

<p>Perhaps Jerome, had he been given a voice in the matter,
as the party most interested, might have strenuously
objected&mdash;baths he liked, indeed, was very partial to, in
their proper season, but to be thus unceremoniously tumbled
from the deck of a steamer into the briny deep, with
his most elaborate evening garments on his person was
really too much of a good thing, and he must have protested
earnestly could he but have found wind with which
to clothe his argument.</p>

<p>That luxury was in a great measure denied him, and
the best he could do was to make a feeble kick against the
decision of the fair court being carried into execution.</p>

<p>It counted for nought.</p>

<p>The American having started could hardly be restrained&mdash;once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
the match is applied to a train of powder it is
difficult to prevent the fire from running its entire length.</p>

<p>So Jerome was dragged ignobly over the deck to the
rail, past the beauty who had ordered his ducking&mdash;he endeavored
to so wind himself about the affections and also
the limbs of his intended executioner that the latter would
have to change his desperate plans or else take the plunge
in his delectable company; but Roderic knew a trick or
two that might be used with profit under such conditions,
and he readily broke the hold of the desperate and vanquished
beau.</p>

<p>Then came the finish.</p>

<p>Wellington took a tumble.</p>

<p>He exhausted what breath he chanced to have in his
lungs with one awful whoop as he went plunging down,
arms and legs outspread after the manner of a gigantic
frog.</p>

<p>Perhaps he found some satisfaction in the fact that he
made the greatest splash ever known in that lovely harbor,
a splash that would go down in the annals of the
Azores as beyond all precedent, and which suddenly
quelled the merry laughter, together with sounds of music
that had floated across the bay.</p>

<p>It is worth considerable to excel in <em>something</em>, even if
it is only a ducking.</p>

<p>Roderic had crossed the Rubicon.</p>

<p>He knew his summary treatment of the Adonis would
create tremendous excitement on board the blockade runner.</p>

<p>There were English sailors in charge and these men
could not be treated with the same measure of scorn that
he might have bestowed had they one and all been Spaniards.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>Nevertheless Roderic was far from being panic-stricken
in any sense.</p>

<p>He had no sooner dropped Jerome over the rail than he
turned to Georgia, and as the noise of the splash still
sounded, said grimly:</p>

<p>"He has been disposed of as you suggested, sweetheart.
Let us hope the temperature of the water will be sufficient
to cool his ardor."</p>

<p>"But you must fly&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sanctissima!</i> they will harm, perhaps
murder you, and I should never forgive myself for
having been the cause. Go, Senor Roderic, go with all
haste!" she exclaimed, her hands on his arm, her lustrous
midnight orbs glowing as they filled with intense excitement.</p>

<p>The man either had a contempt for the peril that
threatened or else hardly grasped its serious nature&mdash;at
least he showed a recklessness in dealing with the situation
that might possibly have been expected when the fact
of his having Irish blood in his veins was taken into consideration,
for seldom have Ireland's sons been in battle
without leading some forlorn hope in the van.</p>

<p>"Not until you tell me again that you love me," he declared,
eagerly.</p>

<p>Some men would have called him a fool, but evidently
they could never have adored a woman&mdash;to the man who
loves, all else gives way before his passion.</p>

<p>So nature has constituted him.</p>

<p>"You already know it," she said, quickly, endeavoring
to push him towards the ladder, and even her eagerness to
insure his safety was a source of deep satisfaction to the
lover.</p>

<p>"But I must hear you say it&mdash;consider, weeks may
elapse before I see you again and I shall be exposed to all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
manner of danger. Tell me," he insisted with a determination
nothing could move but acquiescence.</p>

<p>Perhaps there was one particular danger in her mind
that would hover over him constantly, and against which
she in her innocent, loving heart prayed that he might be
delivered&mdash;Cleo.</p>

<p>However, she realized that he would accept no half way
compromise.</p>

<p>The sailors on board were shouting and running to the
rail to ascertain what species of porpoise or shark kicked
up such a fiendish racket alongside their vessel, for the
wretched Jerome, unable to shout, and actually half
strangled, was threshing the water like a young steam
engine in the endeavor to keep himself afloat and frighten
away the voracious monsters of the deep.</p>

<p>"<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Carramba!</i> foolish man to risk so much for a woman's
word. Know then that I do love you with all my heart
and soul&mdash;the good Father above preserve you, for me!"</p>

<p>It was all he asked.</p>

<p>He snatched one burning kiss and then with a hasty
"adieu, beloved," sprang to the ladder.</p>

<p>It was time.</p>

<p>The ship was heaving with commotion.</p>

<p>Had the startling cry of "fire," always dreaded above
all else at sea, been sounded aboard the blockade runner,
loaded as she was with much ammunition, it could hardly
have created greater excitement than now reigned.</p>

<p>Roderic remained quite cool, which was an advantage
to the success of his venture.</p>

<p>Garbed as he was as a sailor any one might have taken
him for one of the crew hastening to his station, since
the boatswain's shrill whistle had called the sailormen to
man one of the boats.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>It was easy enough work dropping down the ladder,
but as some one chanced to be ascending it at the same
time an unavoidable collision ensued.</p>

<p>Consequently Roderic and the unknown came to the
lower deck in a bunch, and being above, the American
found a comfortable lodging place on the body of his
confrere.</p>

<p>He did not linger.</p>

<p>One ejaculatory Spanish swear word from the ascending
figure as he swooped down upon him gave Roderic a
pretty good idea as to his identity.</p>

<p>Wretched Roblado, fated to again endure all the flings
of outrageous fortune at the hands of the man from over
the sea!</p>

<p>Roderic halted not neither to assist the damaged Spaniard
to arise nor to offer apologies for such unceremonious
conduct.</p>

<p>At such times men cannot be particular as to their
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">modus operandi</i> in conducting their retreat&mdash;the end justifies
the means.</p>

<p>Happily he had not been at all injured by the fall.</p>

<p>He heard an anxious exclamation skyward and had a
glimpse of Georgia looking over the edge of the upper
deck.</p>

<p>It was just like the man to wave his hand and even
kiss his fingers to the girl ere resuming his course toward
the spot where in all probability Captain Beven anxiously
awaited his coming.</p>

<p>A splash announced the launching of a boat.</p>

<p>It was fortunately on the other side of the steamer,
since Jerome had gone over to port.</p>

<p>Even such a small matter might count in the end,
should pursuit be inaugurated when Wellington was rescued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
and managed to regain enough breath to splutter out
the facts.</p>

<p>At any rate Roderic made a note of this point which was
all the more singular because he had other fish to fry just
then.</p>

<p>Fortunately no one attempted to stay his flight&mdash;fortunately
for them perhaps, as well as his own success, for
Roderic was just in the humor to handle any interference
roughly.</p>

<p>What he had just passed through had the effect of
arousing the lion that lay beneath the surface in his nature,
and he was in a condition to do more than his
share of battle.</p>

<p>Passing the groups of sailors hurrying to the rail, he
crossed the deck to where he believed Beven awaited
him, for a glimpse of one or more figures in this quarter
announced that it was not deserted.</p>

<p>To his surprise he saw two men.</p>

<p>Captain Beven had company, and Roderic at first
glance guessed the identity of that tall figure.</p>

<p>It was Don Porfidio.</p>

<p>He had walked with the captain to where his yawl
awaited, instead of proceeding to the quarter deck; and
now he was also able to resist the <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'tempation'">temptation</ins> to rush across
to the other rail in order to gratify his natural curiosity.</p>

<p>It meant something.</p>

<p>Don Porfidio had somehow guessed the truth, or been
let in on the ground floor by Beven.</p>

<p>Was it war, or peace?</p>

<p>Roderic should have disliked the job exceedingly had
he been compelled to administer any sort of drubbing to
his excellency the good and gruff don, but nevertheless
had the fates demanded it he must have obeyed the call
to duty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>On the whole, therefore, he was well pleased when the
big Porto Rican soldier suddenly thrust out his hand, saying:</p>

<p>"<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Por Dios!</i> I honor a brave man who risks much to
see one he loves. Senor Owen, success to you!"</p>

<p>Roderic took the hand that was offered&mdash;he had much
respect for this patriot and veteran.</p>

<p>"Thank you, senor," he replied.</p>

<p>"All is well?"</p>

<p>"Delightfully so."</p>

<p>"<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Cospita!</i> good. And pray, what is the cause of all
that wonderful splashing yonder?" asked the don, as if
suspecting that the Yankee knew.</p>

<p>Roderic, already in the act of following Captain Beven
down the rope ladder that stretched to the yawl below
paused long enough to look up at the general, and laughing
say:</p>

<p>"Ask Jerome!"</p>

<p>"Aha! it is as I thought&mdash;ask Jerome&mdash;undoubtedly
Senor Wellington has met his Waterloo."</p>

<p>But Owen had already dropped down the side of the
blockade runner and into the boat.</p>

<p>Hardly had he gained the yawl than Beven, who was
in the stern sheets said huskily:</p>

<p>"Push off, and away. Pull like tigers, my hearties, for
unless all signs fail we may have a chase before we reach
the yacht."</p>

<p>The men needed no urging.</p>

<p>Once clear of the steamer and they began to ply their
ashen blades with an energy that sent the little boat flying
through the water.</p>

<p>It was a period of suspense.</p>

<p>Roderic kept his eyes fastened upon the stern of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
steamer, for in this quarter would the pursuit be inaugurated,
should one follow.</p>

<p>The shouts had ceased.</p>

<p>An ominous silence seemed to rest upon the scene.</p>

<p>All depended upon whether the wretched Jerome, upon
being rescued from the bay, was in a state to disclose what
he knew, and the readiness that bold Captain Shackelford
would show in following up the clue thus given.</p>

<p>And as he looked, too soon he saw the boat shoot into
view propelled by sturdy arms.</p>

<p>"Faster!" cried Beven at the same moment.</p>

<p>There were six pair of English arms against two, but
the little yawl was light and trimly built, so the chances
seemed pretty evenly divided.</p>

<p>Roderic surveyed the chase as calmly and critically as
though it were a college regatta, with an ordinary loving
cup as the stake instead of his own liberty, perhaps his
life.</p>

<p>"Captain, we shall make it," he said, quietly.</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly," replied laconic Beven, whose practiced
eye had also measured the distance yet to be traversed,
and the slow if steady gain made by their pursuers.</p>

<p>"Steady, boys, do your level best," he added, and the
sturdy tars grunted as they strained at the oars until the
veins stood out like whip cords on their brows.</p>

<p>Meanwhile from the pursuing craft came a variety of
oaths and exclamations characteristic of the bold adventurer
Shackelford, and by means of which he doubtless
expected to secure better work from his toiling men; while
Jerome, having recovered his tongue, and boiling over
with rage, joined his shrill voice to that of the captain,
promising fabulous rewards&mdash;which he would doubtless
pay in notes if called upon&mdash;should they overhaul the will-o'-the-wisp
boat that tauntingly kept just so far ahead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>It was quite exciting while it lasted.</p>

<p>This romantic harbor in the peaceful Azores had seldom
known a more remarkable scene.</p>

<p>Pity it was the darkness robbed those who might have
enjoyed the spectacle, of such a rare sight.</p>

<p>The steam yacht was now close at hand and while those
who pursued still kept up their mad pace it must have
been painfully evident to them that the chase was hopeless.</p>

<p>Perhaps the daring spirit who led them on had desperate
designs of boarding the yacht and dragging away the
object of their vindictive spleen.</p>

<p>Captain Beven was holding the tiller ropes and under
his skillful guidance the yawl turned the yacht's stern,
coming up alongside.</p>

<p>Instantly a hand clutched the painter.</p>

<p>"Aboard with you!" called the skipper.</p>

<p>Roderic was the first to spring on deck, but the others
were at his heels.</p>

<p>To sight the oncoming boat was now their design, and
accordingly they leaped across the deck, believing Shackelford
would head direct for that nearer quarter.</p>

<p>Nor were they mistaken in this surmise, for as they
reached the rail the boat from the blockade runner shot
under them and hauled up alongside.</p>

<small>CAPTAIN BOB GUESSES NOT.</small></h2>


<p>Shackelford was a daring spirit, one of those Britons
who have carried the flag into remote passes of the Indian
border, and whom the desperate fortunes of war never
daunt.</p>

<p>He had doubtless led charges into the jaws of death,
and passed through adventures enough to fill volumes.</p>

<p>In this case however, it was Tartar against Tartar&mdash;British
bulldog <em>vs.</em> British mastiff. When he rubbed up
against such men as Beven and Roderic Owen, he met
those who were of his own calibre, and should the affair
come to blows it promised to be a pretty sight.</p>

<p>When our friends reached the side of the yacht, the
sailors were already there, at least those on deck; and
some signal must have been given below as the boats approached,
for the watch off duty was tumbling out quite
ignorant as to what might be required of them, but ready,
like all seamen of their nationality to do their duty with
vigor.</p>

<p>"Hold off&mdash;our orders are not to receive visitors after
ten o'clock!" cried Beven, as he saw Shackelford rise to
his feet.</p>

<p>"We mean to come aboard," said that worthy.</p>

<p>"Then you go back quicker than you come."</p>

<p>"Beven, I am surprised."</p>

<p>"At what?"</p>

<p>"Your deceiving us."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>"Nonsense, my visit was in good faith."</p>

<p>"You came with a secret object in view&mdash;you kept us
engaged below while your confederate examined our vessel."</p>

<p>"It was prime champagne, Shack."</p>

<p>"Granted, but"&mdash;and here he relieved himself by a tremendous
expletive, "why did you put that spy aboard of
us?"</p>

<p>"In the first place Mr. Owen is no spy. He cares little
or nothing what cargo you carry, but he is deeply interested
in petticoats&mdash;your young lady is his betrothed, and
he vowed he would go with me on board just to see her.
Shackelford, that's a man after your own heart."</p>

<p>And Shackelford, realizing the truth of this point blank
assertion could only growl.</p>

<p>"Interrupted in his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tete a tete</i> with the young lady by
your gentleman there, they had words, being rivals, and
it resulted in Mr. Owen tossing the elegant Adonis overboard.
Shack, that is just what you would have done,
confound you."</p>

<p>Shackelford could not deny it.</p>

<p>Really Captain Beven should have been a lawyer, since
he knew so well how to draw the fire of his adversary,
and leave him not a foot upon which to stand.</p>

<p>"For you to force your way to the deck of my craft
under these conditions I should consider a high act of
piracy and I assure you my men stand here ready to back
me up in all I do. Is it so, men?"</p>

<p>A hearty "ay, ay sir" came ringing from the crew.</p>

<p>"Now Captain Shackelford, if you choose to board me
you do so at your own risk. There be English arms and
hearts here just as stanch as your own. Come by daylight
and by Heavens I will receive you as an honored<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
guest&mdash;yes, and open another basket of champagne for
the occasion; but I beg of you let discretion play the part
of valor now."</p>

<p>Shackelford knew he held a weak hand&mdash;that any attempt
to board this craft flying the British jack and drag
from her deck a subject of the United States foreign
diplomatic service would not only embroil him in present
difficulties and probably result in a broken head, but
future results promised to make things exceedingly lively
for him.</p>

<p>Great Britain was going out of her way to bring about
an era of good feeling between America and the mother
country&mdash;she had shown in many matters how sincere her
sympathies were and that blood was thicker than water.</p>

<p>Hence, he might expect severe handling from the legal
and military authorities of both countries.</p>

<p>Although Bob Shackelford had always been accounted
pretty much of a dare devil he really drew the line at
throwing his gauntlet into the ring and sending a defiance
to two nations&mdash;that would probably be a little too strong
for his blood.</p>

<p>Here was a chance to draw out with honor.</p>

<p>Shackelford accepted the olive branch.</p>

<p>"Well, Beven, you put the matter pretty strongly, and
I am inclined to yield. Give me your solemn pledge that
this gentleman boarded us as a lover and not as a spy,
and," here he expressed himself very forcibly in the genuine
Shackelford style&mdash;"I'll draw off and spare you the
gore of battle that must come when Greek meets Greek."</p>

<p>"I give you that pledge," replied Beven, readily.</p>

<p>"Why did he go in disguise then?" was the final query
from the other, who had not as yet grasped the full significance
of affairs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>"Because he had enemies on board yonder boat&mdash;you
carry Spaniards, and his country is at war with Spain.
They want him badly, and he is no fool. Captain, I am
under obligations for your courtesy. Come and see me
to-morrow and I'll keep my promise."</p>

<p>Shackelford smacked his lips.</p>

<p>"By Jove! I'll try and oblige you, my boy," he declared,
enthusiastically, as he dropped down upon the thwart.</p>

<p>The incident was closed.</p>

<p>There would be no broken heads, no old time boarding
of the craft, no hot time in the harbor <em>that</em> night.</p>

<p>Reason had resumed her sway, pushing valor and blind
passion into the background.</p>

<p>One there was whom disappointment cut to the quick.</p>

<p>A figure arose in the boat, a bedraggled figure, with one
arm of his evening coat almost divorced from its moorings
on account of the vigor shown by the British tars in dragging
the owner aboard&mdash;a figure that was just the opposite
of the usually dandified Jerome, the pink of neatness,
the epitome of current style.</p>

<p>"What," he ejaculated, "you decline to go aboard and
drag the fellow away? I am astonished beyond measure&mdash;I
did not expect this of you, Captain Bob."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm satisfied with the explanation given. If you
still object, sir, we'll hold the boat here and let you go
aboard and get him. Of course you'd have to shoulder
the whole responsibility&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Pull away," muttered Jerome, suddenly dropping back
to his seat and endeavoring to look as small as possible.</p>

<p>Roderic guessed the reason.</p>

<p>The Adonis had discovered that he was the cynosure of
bright eyes from the cabin&mdash;all this excitement had not
passed without arousing Cleo and Miss Becky&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
former had not really retired at all, but awaited her
cousin's return from his mission of love&mdash;perhaps her
earnest prayers had followed him, even to the arms of her
successful rival.</p>

<p>The blockade runner's boat shot quickly over the darkened
water toward the lights that indicated the spot where
the steamer was anchored.</p>

<p>Thus the coast was again clear.</p>

<p>Captain Beven turned and shook Roderic's hand.</p>

<p>He was bubbling over with suppressed laughter.</p>

<p>"Congratulations, sir, over your success. A miss is as
good as a mile, they say," he declared.</p>

<p>"Ah!" remarked the satisfied lover, "in this case it is a
senorita, and she is worth many miles. My thanks are
due to you, captain, for the able assistance given. May
all our future plans be founded on as firm a basis."</p>

<p>"Amen," said Beven, solemnly.</p>

<p>He was thinking of that basket of very Extra Dry, and
the taste still lingered as though its memory would haunt
him for many a day.</p>

<p>For once he stood ready to immolate his comfort on the
altar of friendship every night, providing the emolument
came in such pleasant fashion.</p>

<p>They chatted a short time, and generally upon the subject
mostly in evidence.</p>

<p>Beven was naturally curious to hear how the Adonis,
who was no milk and water warrior himself, came to take
such a fearful plunge into the bay.</p>

<p>He could give a shrewd guess that the act had not been
a voluntary one on his part, and desired to hear what
share Roderic had in it.</p>

<p>This was soon told in the most matter of fact fashion
by the modest young man&mdash;indeed, one might almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
imagine from his manner of putting it that Jerome had
fallen overboard instead of being tossed there.</p>

<p>Beven knew how to put his own construction on the
incident, and could guess just what his principal had done.</p>

<p>Roderic was really unfitted for sleep after such an hour
of intense excitement, and thought he would walk the
quarterdeck for a time until his pipe had soothed the excited
nerves and brought him to a condition where slumber
might be possible.</p>

<p>He had not been back and forth a dozen times ere a
girlish figure joined him.</p>

<p>Of course it was Cousin Cleo, who desired to share his
walk and mayhap his confidence, even though what he
might relate would cut keenly.</p>

<p>The moth will persist in fluttering about the bright
flame of the candle even after its wings are slightly singed.</p>

<p>Silly moth&mdash;wicked candle!</p>

<p>And yet the world goes on, new moths come and the
same old story with variations, is repeated.</p>

<p>Roderic professed to be displeased at the idea of Cleo
coming up to join him in this midnight tramp.</p>

<p>Secretly the man was delighted, for he felt the human
desire to confide his hopes and fears in a sympathetic ear,
and though he would rather it had been some one else
than Cleo, still, she knew much of his love affairs, and
had promised to be a sister to him&mdash;he would be egotistical
and foolish to ever believe that she cared for him other
than a dear sister might.</p>

<p>"My dear cousin, why do you come on deck&mdash;don't you
know that at this hour in this semi-tropical climate the
dew is falling, and it is very unhealthy for one to be exposed
to the night air?"</p>

<p>She laughed in his face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, you are to blame. I should have been in my
little bunk and probably far away in the Land of Nod had
you been content to remain aboard and not start out on a
very Quixotic errand. But I am only joking, Roderic.
You have met with adventures, of that I am sure from
what I saw and heard. Poor Jerome has once more
crossed your path and found it one of thorns. Now, you
must tell me all that happened, do you hear, Sir Galahad?"</p>

<p>A little hand slipped through his arm, and Roderic
found himself obliged to surrender.</p>

<p>So, as they walked up and down he told the story of
what had occurred; several times they paused at the rail
to look at the riding lights that marked the position of the
blockade runner, and while one sighed in rapturous satisfaction
at the thought of the beauty aboard the Sterling
Castle, the other experienced quite a different emotion.</p>

<p>Cleo asked questions, and seemed bound to know all, so
he felt compelled to tell her.</p>

<p>Her interest in Georgia grew with each passing day,
and strange to say the yearning to meet and know this
daughter of the tropics became an absorbing dream&mdash;she
felt as though destiny drew their life lines in the same
channel, these two who both loved Roderic Owen.</p>

<p>Perhaps he was wise enough to refrain from entering
into minute particulars when describing the interview
with Georgia&mdash;even men head over heels in love are given
a small amount of common sense on occasions of this kind.</p>

<p>Finally Roderic persuaded her to retire.</p>

<p>The hour was late and he himself now confessed to
drowsiness.</p>

<p>By this time the town had given up its mad merriment&mdash;gone
were many of the lights and the music of the band
had long since ceased to be a factor in the mighty drama.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>Even in the romantic Azores men must take a portion
of the night for sleep&mdash;it cannot be given wholly over to
song and amusement.</p>

<p>Captain Beven was a wary old sea dog.</p>

<p>He believed an ounce of prevention to be much better
than a pound of cure.</p>

<p>There was no danger in sight, and probably it would be
an act of madness on Shackelford's part to attempt to
board the steam yacht under cover of darkness and secure
the person of the man who had been aboard the blockade
runner in disguise.</p>

<p>All the same, chances or not, Beven did not intend to
neglect any precaution, for he was a man who did not believe
in being caught napping.</p>

<p>To shut the door after the horse was stolen might be
good policy with some men, but his idea lay in securing it
ere this event happened.</p>

<p>Before retiring Roderic had an interview with the captain,
and learned that worthy's views.</p>

<p>Then he sought his little stateroom.</p>

<p>As fortune would have it he was situated on that side of
the boat nearer the steamer, and from either one of the
bulls-eye openings he could see the uncertain dark mass
that told just where the blockade runner lay, as well as
her twinkling riding lights which must be kept burning
the livelong night in order to prevent accident should
arriving vessels enter the snug harbor.</p>

<p>And Roderic stood there a long time, his eyes fixed
upon the inchoate outlines of the Sterling Castle, as one
might gaze upon a vessel that bore his fate.</p>

<p>Many thoughts occupied his mind&mdash;he lived over again
the past with its joys and sorrows, and even attempted
to raise the veil of the future to see whether it held a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
gleam of Paradise; but this must all remain surmise and
uncertainty, since it is not given to mortal vision to see
beyond the present.</p>

<p>The night passed without an alarm.</p>

<p>Evidently Shackelford was a man of discretion as well
as astonishing boldness, for there is such a thing as uniting
the two qualities.</p>

<p>Roderic aroused early enough.</p>

<p>The morning had just broken and the glowing eye of
old Ph&oelig;bus was glancing above the horizon when he proceeded
to dress.</p>

<p>This operation had been about completed when, by
chance of course, he looked out of the port hole to see just
how far they were from the steamer, since darkness had
been upon land and water during the little drama of the
preceding night.</p>

<p>To his surprise he failed to behold the object of his
solicitude.</p>

<p>He rubbed his eyes and looked again&mdash;surely he must
be dreaming, or else with a change of tide the steam yacht
had headed another way, cutting him off from the view
he had before obtained.</p>

<p>And yet, so far as he could tell his lookout still faced
the town and port, and he could swear the blockade runner
should lie between.</p>

<p>Mayhap Shackelford had taken his craft in to a dock
for some purpose.</p>

<p>Roderic snatched up his marine glasses and scanned the
shore line.</p>

<p>There was only disappointment awaiting him.</p>

<p>The yellow and black funnel of the Sterling Castle was
conspicuous only by its absence.</p>

<p>One chance remained&mdash;that the steamer had changed
her anchorage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>He hurriedly completed his toilet and rushed on deck.</p>

<p>A sweeping glance around told the story, for the blockade
runner was no longer in the harbor.</p>

<p>Captain Beven saluted from a point forward and beckoned
him to approach.</p>

<p>"Looking for the steamer&mdash;left port an hour or more
before crack of dawn&mdash;yonder she goes, headed straight
for the Antilles."</p>

<p>Following the captain's extended finger Roderic saw the
smoke of a steamer hanging on the horizon. Somehow
his heart gave a leap after it, for the girl he adored was
aboard the vanishing craft.</p>

<p>"When do we follow, captain?" he asked, composedly.</p>

<p>"Within six hours at the latest," was the reply and
when that time had expired they too were moving over
the trackless Atlantic headed due south west.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><a name="Chapter_XVI" id="Chapter_XVI"></a>CHAPTER XVI.<br />

<small>THE INVASION OF SAN JUAN.</small></h2>


<p>Upon a stormy night, when the moon was utterly concealed
by dark ragged masses of clouds that rolled up
from the south in serried columns like an army advancing
to battle, Roderic viewed the prospect from the deck of the
Dreadnaught with the philosophical coolness that seemed
a part of his nature; and yet he knew what one of these
summer storms in the tropics meant as well as any man.</p>

<p>It came in an unfortunate time, just when they prayed
for fair weather, since it was Roderic's design to be put
ashore on the coast of Porto Rico not many miles from
San Juan, before the little steam yacht entered the fortified
harbor.</p>

<p>The situation had been carefully studied by Owen, and
his plans altered to conform to the new arrangement of
affairs.</p>

<p>There was a pretty good chance that the Sterling Castle
would put into San Juan ere attempting to run the
Havana blockade.</p>

<p>In fact this was almost a certainty, since she carried as
passengers those who were desirous of landing on Porto
Rico soil.</p>

<p>This being the case it was reasonable to suppose that
Jerome and his Spanish allies would take advantage of
the first opportunity to warn the officials at the capital regarding
the presence of a Yankee secret agent on board
Cleo's yacht; and that the entry of the Dreadnaught into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
the fortified harbor where Admiral Sampson's guns had
played havoc earlier in the game would open a system of
annoying espionage, even if it did not result in a bold
search for the spy.</p>

<p>There was one way to avoid this.</p>

<p>He must go ashore secretly and enter San Juan by the
backdoor.</p>

<p>His acquaintance with the city and its surroundings
would serve him in good stead, as must also his knowledge
of the Spanish character and language.</p>

<p>Roderic had his bold plans all arranged and was therefore
a little annoyed when fickle Nature threatened to interfere
with their smooth sailing. If the tropical storm
had only held off another hour all would have been serene.</p>

<p>They had had glimpses of Porto Rico's fair shores
during the last few hours, and Roderic might have landed
in comfort.</p>

<p>Two things restrained him&mdash;the lack of suitable transportation
facilities to the capital, and the presence of
Spanish soldiers scattered along the shore, and revealed
through the glasses.</p>

<p>Night was absolutely necessary for the successful carrying
out of his plans, and even then there had been danger
from discovery on account of the moon.</p>

<p>The storm obviated this, while it bred new perils of its
own.</p>

<p>Roderic decided to risk it.</p>

<p>Delay meant more danger for Cleo, since every hour
spent upon that coast in a gale of wind, during the hurricane
season of the year was tempting Providence.</p>

<p>Once he was off their hands he could run away from
the coast or else make for the shelter of San Juan harbor,
which would surely not be refused any friendly craft on
such a wretched night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>So Roderic made all his preparations and transformed
himself into a dark visaged Spaniard.</p>

<p>Cleo looked him over carefully, and tried her best to
appear satisfied, though there was a haunting gleam of
dread in her blue eyes, and her lips trembled, despite all
attempts to show a resolute front.</p>

<p>She knew what risks he was taking for his country.</p>

<p>The same bold spirit that influenced Hobson and Blue
and Wainwright in their desperate ventures grew rampant
in Roderic Owen's breast&mdash;a strong desire to strike a blow
for his beloved flag, to cripple the power of the proud
Spaniard and hasten the day of his final departure from
the Western Hemisphere.</p>

<p>Captain Beven had anchored his craft and now came to
announce the boat in readiness that was to take him
ashore.</p>

<p>Roderic took his cousin's hand in both his own.</p>

<p>"Your pure heart will pray for me I know. It is a
greater satisfaction to me than words can tell. Remember
what I promised of San Juan. We will, God willing,
soon meet again. As your cousin, your brother, dear
Cleo, allow me a brother's loving privilege."</p>

<p>He kissed her farewell.</p>

<p>Nor as he turned hastily to follow Beven to the waiting
boat, did he see the glowing flush that instantly suffused
her face, to as rapidly vanish, leaving her deathly
pale and trembling like an aspen leaf.</p>

<p>The ride ashore was exhilarating to say the <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'lesat'">least</ins>.</p>

<p>Great waves rolled on the beach, and none but practical,
experienced seamen could have managed so light a yawl
without disaster.</p>

<p>But Roderic had no fear&mdash;he knew what these trained
muscles could do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>Several times they seemed threatened with dire disaster,
but on each occasion the second officer's judgment
in manipulating the boat averted destruction.</p>

<p>Thus the cockle shell craft entered the white crested
breakers, where they surged upon the shore with a roar
like unto that of thunder.</p>

<p>This was the most interesting moment of all, as riding
one of the rollers they rushed in like a race horse on the
home stretch.</p>

<p>Then Roderic saw the palm trees against the sky line
almost overhead, and he knew they were almost ashore.</p>

<p>A grating sound under their keel announced the
receding of the billow.</p>

<p>Instantly every sailor leaped overboard, up to his knees
in salt water, and the boat thus lightened was run ashore.</p>

<p>And in this manner Roderic Owen once again found
himself on Spanish soil&mdash;two years had passed since in
anger he had kicked the dust of Porto Rico from his
shoes, and registered a solemn vow never to tread its
shores again while his good sense remained.</p>

<p>This occurred to him now as a very grim joke, for here
he was once more landed on that same fated soil; and
what was even more singular as fully bent as ever upon
his chase after beauty.</p>

<p>Time alters many cases, resolutions fade with age, and
circumstances govern our actions to a remarkable degree.</p>

<p>Of course it was absolutely necessary that the second
officer and his men should return to the yacht without
delay.</p>

<p>Roderic squeezed the bold fellows by the hand and
watched them launch their boat through the surf.</p>

<p>Twice they were driven back.</p>

<p>It was a ticklish job.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>Such men could not be daunted by difficulties, even
when out of the common, so they made a still more resolute
attempt.</p>

<p>The third trial was a grand success&mdash;sturdy British
muscle had conquered over the forces of Nature, and
Roderic knew they were off.</p>

<p>He waited and watched until he saw a light flash up
three times far out on the stormy waters, which was the
signal agreed upon to announce the safe return of the
yawl.</p>

<p>Then with a sigh he turned away.</p>

<p>His business was now to enter San Juan.</p>

<p>It must prove one that would necessitate great caution
and considerable endurance on his part, for since the bombardment
of the ports by the American fleet as a bluff intended
to disclose the presence of Cervera's squadron in
West India waters the Spanish authorities had taken
extraordinary precautions to guard every avenue of approach
to the capital.</p>

<p>Roderic did not doubt his ability to enter without discovery&mdash;he
had not frequented the cafes, the Spanish
Club, and taken many horseback rides through the suburbs
of San Juan in company with Georgia without gaining
a thorough knowledge of the ground that promised to
be of great advantage to him now.</p>

<p>Putting his best foot forward he soon struck a military
road over which he had spun many times behind a good
horse.</p>

<p>He could in an hour's time catch glimpses of the many
lights that marked the city.</p>

<p>The sight caused him considerable satisfaction, for he
knew destiny had in store for him events of considerable
importance connected with San Juan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>And doubtless <em>she</em> was there&mdash;that simple fact had in it
the elements calculated to thrill his very heart to its core.</p>

<p>About this time there arose features connected with
the case that temporarily drove these sweet reflections out
of his head.</p>

<p>They were of a most disagreeable nature.</p>

<p>It began to rain.</p>

<p>This might signify a drizzle in a more northern clime,
but such a thing is almost unknown in Porto Rico.</p>

<p>When the clouds open there it means a deluge.</p>

<p>The boys in blue who were in the trenches at Santiago
could tell some pretty tall stories of tropical downpours,
and how in the rainy season a cloud appearing no larger
than one's hat can spread over all the sky and fairly soak
the earth.</p>

<p>Roderic had anticipated this&mdash;indeed, his preparations
had been made with just such a ducking in prospect.</p>

<p>He took his medicine in a philosophical spirit such as
only a traveler in many strange lands learns to cultivate.</p>

<p>Every step brought him nearer the city, and once he was
soaked through it was impossible to become any wetter, so
why complain?</p>

<p>Besides, this deluge might serve to his advantage, since
in all probability the guards stationed along the military
road would naturally seek refuge in their shelter huts,
and leave the way clear.</p>

<p>This was what actually occurred.</p>

<p>Spanish system lacks many sterling elements that make
the German and British armies so thorough in their duties.</p>

<p>Roderic after a miserable tramp through mud and water
finally brought up at the city gates an hour before midnight.</p>

<p>There he met with an apparent obstacle, since in Moorish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
fashion no one was allowed to find ingress or egress
during the period between sunset and sunrise.</p>

<p>This he had been aware of ere landing, and all his plans
were shaped with an utter disregard for the edict of the
governor-general.</p>

<p>Avoiding the gates discreetly he made his way along
the dilapidated wall that marked what had once been the
land defense of the city.</p>

<p>It was now in decay, like many other antiquated battlements
connected with Spain's possessions throughout the
world&mdash;relics of <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'byegone'">bygone</ins> days when muzzle loading guns
marked the highest epoch in the art of war.</p>

<p>Of course this guarding of the gates was more or less of
a big sham, since the people of San Juan could go and
come in scores of other places.</p>

<p>And Roderic remembered this fact.</p>

<p>When by turning this way and that he finally surmounted
the difficulty, and found himself among the
houses near the barracks of the troops in the eastern
end of the city, he felt as though he deserved congratulations
on account of his good generalship.</p>

<p>Still this was but a beginning, one step in the long and
difficult ladder he had laid out to climb. It could only be
ascended a single round at a time, but he had really made
a good start.</p>

<p>He found himself in a portion of San Juan which he
had really never looked upon under similar conditions,
the quarter where the poorer element herded, where
houses were thronged with black and white, Spaniards,
and reconcentradoes of Porto Rico who endeavored to remain
neutral, negroes from Jamaica and Hayti and a mongrel
population.</p>

<p>Seldom even in the rainy season does such a downpour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
come at night&mdash;they look for it in the afternoon,
when it cools the sultry atmosphere and with the sea
breeze renders the evening delightfully refreshing.</p>

<p>Just then the streets were swimming in water, and almost
practically deserted&mdash;even the dolorous cry of the
"dulce" vendors had ceased to echo along the narrow
thoroughfares.</p>

<p>But the cafes and concert halls and shops appeared to be
doing a land office business to judge from the crowds that
had collected.</p>

<p>Roderic's one desire now was to reach a little den just
off the breathing place for the poor, known as the Plaza
Cristobal Colon in honor of Columbus.</p>

<p>Here he believed he would find the opportunity he
craved for rest, and a chance to dry his reeking garments,
under the humble roof of a devoted friend.</p>

<p>Two years had passed since last he had seen this party,
and two years is a long time&mdash;much may occur during
such a period&mdash;people change their residence mayhap their
country, and sometimes even die.</p>

<p>Still he was ready to take the chances.</p>

<p>No one halted him as he pushed on, and yet these narrow,
illy lighted streets could not be reckoned the safest
places in the city for respectable people to walk after a
certain hour.</p>

<p>One thing he noticed&mdash;San Juan was full of Spanish
soldiers. He could see them prowling everywhere, and
each crowd within the cafes and halls had its quota of
these small sized swarthy faced, boyish looking exiles
from sunny Spain.</p>

<p>"They evidently mean to give the Yankees a warm reception
when the time comes," was what he concluded
upon noting this important fact.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>The point was well taken&mdash;it was one that would prove
of considerable importance to General Miles, who had
already landed on the southern coast with his army of
Americans, and was beginning to advance upon Ponce
and the neighboring towns.</p>

<p>After being compelled to retrace his steps several times,
on account of getting off the track, confused by the narrow
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">calles</i> that seemed to have no beginning and ended
nowhere, Roderic at length broke out upon an open place
where the rain beat upon stone flagging, and trees moaned
dolefully in the fierce gusts of wind.</p>

<p>Despite its funereal aspect now he recognized this as
the Plaza Cristobal Colon, and was able to take his bearings
afresh.</p>

<p>"Thank Heaven, I am near the end of my night's pilgrimage,"
he muttered in Spanish, for he had determined
to even do his thinking in that language while within the
enemy's lines, so that the danger of discovery might be
reduced to a minimum, for if Jerome, Roblado <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">et al.</i> were
in San Juan he was well aware of the fact that hundreds
of keen eyes belonging to the Guardia Civil would be on
the lookout for one Roderic Owen, and that discovery
would be a serious matter for him.</p>

<p>It was really time his wanderings ceased for this night
at least&mdash;he had covered miles of ground, he had faced a
raging storm that at times almost brought him to his
knees, he was soaked through and through, and beginning
to feel weak in his limbs.</p>

<p>But relief was close at hand.</p>

<p>The hardest part of his mission he believed had already
been passed over.</p>

<p>At least, in all probability he would be able to conduct
the remainder of his work with a dry skin&mdash;he might not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
see another deluge in the early night during his whole stay
in San Juan.</p>

<p>He fervently hoped so, at least.</p>

<p>Crossing the public square he dodged into a certain
dingy and crooked lane that took him to the most desolate
and God forsaken locality within the city walls.</p>

<p>There are such places in Paris, London, New York&mdash;why
not in San Juan?</p>

<p>All cities, whether of ancient Babylonian days or of the
present enlightened age have had their plague spots as
well as their palatial quarters, and so it must be while
rich and poor go hand in hand, down to the end of time.</p>

<p>Only in San Juan the squalor seemed to be a little more
pronounced than anything Roderic could imagine outside
of Havana, where the wretched reconcentradoes were dying
of hunger by thousands.</p>

<p>The war was partly to blame, he knew&mdash;that and the
natural savage instinct which prevails so strongly among
Spanish speaking people, and induces them to always go
to extremes, whether in love or conflict.</p>

<p>Picking his way along in this delectable neighborhood
Roderic finally gave utterance to an eager exclamation&mdash;his
eyes had fallen upon the little whitewashed cabin for
which he had been on the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">qui vive</i>.</p>

<p>Another moment and his fist was beating a tattoo upon
the door, a summons that was loud enough to arouse the
dead&mdash;from within a movement was heard, and then the
door opened cautiously a few inches. Roderic uttered
some talismanic words in Spanish that brought a delighted
exclamation from the hut's occupant&mdash;a brown hand
reached out and when the door closed it shut out the awful
clamor of the storm, for the Yankee had found a warm
reception within the walls of old San Juan.</p>

<small>THE BOLERO DANCER WITH THE GYPSY BLOOD.</small></h2>


<p>Porto Rico as a territory of the progressive American
republic will soon be transformed&mdash;while advancing with
giant strides along the material road that may lead to
statehood, the island must gradually lose those picturesque
and distinctly national features that have marked
Spanish rule for centuries.</p>

<p>Never again will San Juan be the same gay, careless,
pleasure seeking capital of the past&mdash;the business loving,
bustling Yankee shopkeeper banishes such folly, or at
best makes it play second fiddle to his trading.</p>

<p>San Juan will be swept and garnished, her streets paved,
her narrowest <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">calles</i> lighted, and within a few years she
may vie even with Boston in regard to the conditions that
make life worth living to the average American.</p>

<p>But the halo of romance and the worship of military
heroes that has been her portion during these long centuries&mdash;alas!
they have fled, to return no more.</p>

<p>Many will sigh as they raise the curtain of the past, and
take one more peep at the gay bright scene stamped upon
memory's tablets.</p>

<p>There is a peculiar fascination about Spanish and
Oriental cities, a barbaric splendor that attracts the eye,
even while our common sense tells us of its tawdry nature.</p>

<p>Many have described the San Juan of the past, and as a
picture that has been turned to the wall, let us for the last
time see the Porto Rican capital through the glasses of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
clever newspaperman, whose pen paints its colors just as
might the faithful camera. This was as Roderic saw it
the day after his safe entry into the town:</p>

<p>San Juan wakes early.</p>

<p>By seven o'clock the shops are open, and a stirring of
wide shutters in the upper stories of the houses shows that
even the women are about. Hundreds of men are having
their coffee in the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">caf&eacute;s</i>. Probably a band is playing
somewhere, which means a detachment of troops returning
from early mass in the Cathedral.</p>

<p>By ten o'clock this early activity has worn itself out.
The sun has got well up into the sky, white and hot. It
falls in the narrow, unshaded streets, and the cobblestones
begin to scorch through thin shoe soles. It is a time to
seek the shade and quaff cooling drinks. Business languishes.
About eleven shop shutters begin to go up, and
soon the streets are as deserted as at midnight.</p>

<p>This is breakfast hour, and until well after noon not a
shop or public building will be found open. About one or
two, whether the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">siesta</i> is long or short, people begin to
reappear and the shops reopen. Gradually traffic revives.
By four o'clock, when the Palais de Justice has cast its
cooling shadow over half the blazing plaza, loungers begin
to appear to occupy the numerous benches and blink
idly at the guards about the gloomy Palais entrance. With
each passing hour the city presents a livelier appearance,
until at six o'clock it is fully awake and ready for dinner,
the principal meal of the day.</p>

<p>In the evening is when the inhabitants of San Juan
really live. These are the pleasant hours of the day. From
the sea comes a breeze, cool and fresh, to whisper to the
few shade trees in the plazas and revive enervated humanity.
Twice a week one of the military bands plays in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
the principal plaza. Then it is worth while to go, hire a
comfortable arm chair from a <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">muchacho</i> for ten <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">centavos</i>
in Puerto Rican silver and sit and observe and listen.</p>

<p>These military bands&mdash;there are three stationed in San
Juan&mdash;are equal to Sousa or Herbert on a considerably
smaller scale. They play beautifully voluptuous airs of
sunny Spain, the strains swelling and quickening until
they entice an answer in the livened step and unconsciously
swaying bodies of hundreds of promenaders;
then slowly dying to a sweet, soft breath, borne to the ear
from distant guitars and mandolins. Italian, French and
German composers are not neglected, while occasionally
there will come a spirited bit from some modern light
opera, or even a snatch from a topical song of the day.</p>

<p>On band nights San Juan may be seen at her best. The
concerts begin at eight o'clock. Prior to that hour the
private soldiers are permitted the liberty of the plaza, and
hundreds avail themselves of the opportunity for an airing.
At eight they must retire to their barracks, leaving
the plaza to the officers.</p>

<p>The music racks are set at one end of the plaza, and the
musicians stand during the two hours of the concert. By
the time the second number on the programme is reached
the plaza is thronged with the wealth, beauty and fashion
of the Puerto Rican capital. A row of gas street lamps,
thickly set, encircles the Plaza, while at each end rise iron
towers, upon which are supported electric arc lights.</p>

<p>All the houses surrounding the plaza are illuminated,
their bright coloring and Eastern architecture giving an
Oriental effect. The balconies&mdash;every house has a balcony&mdash;are
filled with gaily dressed women and officers,
and through open windows glimpses of richly furnished
interiors can be obtained. On the street level, the Grand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
Central and other <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">caf&eacute;s</i>, the Spanish Club and a dozen
brilliantly lighted drug stores and shops help flood the
plaza with light and lend life and gayety to the scene.</p>

<p>The throng is characteristic of San Juan of to-day&mdash;of
the San Juan which will soon cease to exist. There are
Spanish officers, hundreds of them, clad in an immense
variety of uniform&mdash;to use a perfectly truthful paradox.</p>

<p>There are officers of the Guardia Civil, in dark blue
suits and caps, their cuffs red and gold, the rank indicated
by eight pointed stars, and with small spurs sticking out
from under the long trousers.</p>

<p>There are officers of the line, usually in light or indigo
blue, sometimes with broad stripes along the trousers and
with cuffs and facings of green, red, blue or black, according
to the branch of the service, their rank indicated by
gold and silver stars on the sleeve above the cuff. These
wear tall white caps, with gilt bands. There are naval
officers, in dark blue uniforms of distinctly seafaring cut
and without colored facings.</p>

<p>All the officers wear some kind of sword invariably,
usually during the day the regulation sabre, and at night
substituting a slender rapier with a cross hilt. They also
carry walking sticks with silver and gold heads, according
to rank.</p>

<p>As they mingle with the crowd, walking together in
groups, now bowing to some passing female acquaintance
or turning to promenade with her, they unconsciously
dominate the entire assemblage and give to it an indelible
imprint of Spain. Plainly they are favorites with the
women, who receive their polite attentions graciously.</p>

<p>And the women. They are out in force, dressed in the
latest fashions of Madrid and Paris. Here and there
some gentleman walks with his wife and family, but usually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
the women promenade alone until joined by male acquaintances.
A group of girls will be accompanied by a
duenna, who keeps discreetly in the background if any
men approach. Often, however, two or more senoritas
will promenade entirely alone, with a freedom which
would be considered unbecoming in the United States.</p>

<p>This is one of the occasions when rigorous Spanish
etiquette is somewhat relaxed and the unmarried women
enjoy a fleeting glimpse of social freedom. So the crowd,
constantly swelling, until progress is almost impossible,
moves in a circle back and forth along the length of the
plaza. Mingling with it are scores of police, in their
bright uniforms, who seem to have no business there except
to accentuate the crush, and hundreds of civilians in
their best dress. And so it goes, until the concert ends.
The band, preceded by an escort of cavalry, marches away
to a wonderfully quick quickstep, the lights fade and
slowly the crowd disperses through the shadowy streets.</p>

<p>Not all San Juan, however, is to be seen in the grand
plaza. Only fashionable and official life centralizes there.
In other sections of the city the evenings pass differently.
Take a stroll from the brilliantly lighted plaza into the
eastern part of the town, near the barracks.</p>

<p>There the whole lower strata will be found in the narrow,
badly lighted streets, or in the plaza Cristobal Colon
and the smaller breathing places of the densely populated
city.</p>

<p>Here hand organs and dirty wandering minstrels, who
perform semi-barbaric music upon cracked guitars and
raspy mandolins, accompanied by the "guero"&mdash;a native
instrument made of a gourd&mdash;furnish the music.</p>

<p>Venders of <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">dulce</i> squat beside their trays of sweetmeat,
dolorously crying their wares. Non-commissioned officers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
and privates mingle with the people and chat with the
women. Everybody smokes cigarettes, even children
hardly able to toddle. The shops and meaner <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">caf&eacute;s</i> are
open and crowded.</p>

<p>Further no one can wander through streets more narrow
and darker than alleys to where the massive gray battlements
of the ancient city walls lift their sombre, jagged
towers to greet the moon.</p>

<p>Inquisitive sentinels, Mauser rifle in hand, walk here to
turn intruders back, but by exercising discretion glimpses
may be obtained of tiny balconies ensconced in nooks and
crannies high up in the wall and overlooking the sea and
the twinkling city. Perhaps a peep may be had into the
odd habitations within, with dusky senoritas gazing out
through a curtain of flowers and vines. This is a different
San Juan from that which promenades in the plaza:
but not less interesting.</p>

<p>All this Roderic Owen saw, nor was it the first time he
had wandered through the streets and <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'byeways'">byways</ins> of the
strange old city.</p>

<p>How vividly these scenes brought back to his mind the
days and nights of the past, when he had lived in a glow
of love's young dream&mdash;still, why need he sigh&mdash;the experience
through which he had passed, bitter though it had
been, must have taught him a lesson, and since Love had
again taken up an abode in his heart, he could profit by
it to forever debar the little demon Jealousy from entering
this holiest of holies.</p>

<p>He wandered over the whole city.</p>

<p>He even found means to enter some of the forts that
frowned so ferociously, and yet were but hollow mockeries,
mounting few modern guns.</p>

<p>Here were evidences still of the damage inflicted by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
Sampson's fleet many weeks before&mdash;Spanish dilatory tactics
had allowed dismounted guns to lie where they had
fallen, and Roderic was of the opinion that it must have
been rather warm around those regions at the time.</p>

<p>There was something of a bustle of preparation in the
city, since it had become known that General Miles and an
American army had landed on the south shore of the
island.</p>

<p>Still the Spaniards did not expect to make a desperate
resistance like Blanco had declared Havana would show.</p>

<p>When the Yankee army reached San Juan and the terrible
battle ships appeared again in the offing doubtless
they would gracefully submit to the inevitable and yield
up their arms.</p>

<p>Meanwhile there was the usual bluster and braggadocio
as to what they meant to do with the Yankee pigs once
they were induced <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'in'">to</ins> enter the trap which the Spanish
commander had so cunningly spread.</p>

<p>They would be extravagantly comical, these bold soldiers
of Spain, if they were not so very serious in what
they declared.</p>

<p>Roderic laughed in his sleeve at the awful threats so
openly made in street and cafe, wherever two or more
soldiers came together&mdash;in imagination he pictured the
overwhelming rush of regulars and volunteers in blue,
just as they had gone into the Spaniards at Caney and
San Juan hill&mdash;one such mad swoop and he was ready to
swear to it that the Porto Rican capital would be carried.</p>

<p>Brag is a good dog, but Holdfast a better.</p>

<p>Roderic did not use his whole time in tramping about
the city.</p>

<p>He made several visits to people who had been in communication<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
with the Washington authorities, influential
English residents or even native Porto Ricans who knew
what was written by Destiny upon the wall, and longed
for the blessed day to dawn when Liberty would descend
upon the sons and daughters of the Antilles.</p>

<p>His object was not to get information concerning the
resources of the garrison.</p>

<p>All those points he was able to pick up for himself in
his round of the city and forts.</p>

<p>As a government official he had come to San Juan, and
it was in this capacity he conferred with these influential
citizens.</p>

<p>When he had finally accomplished all that was expected
of him in this direction, Roderic threw off the burden
of responsibility.</p>

<p>He was now free to think once more of his own personal
affairs, to let the vision of Georgia's lovely face occupy
his mind as it had his heart.</p>

<p>How he longed to see her.</p>

<p>How fitting it seemed that the romance of his life, that
had obtained its first lease in San Juan, should complete
the circuit there, amid these well remembered scenes.</p>

<p>It was concert night.</p>

<p>Even with a hostile army marching against the capital
these Spanish soldiers, who, as old campaigners laughed
at fate, did not mean to be cheated out of their usual
pleasure.</p>

<p>Among the throngs on the plaza Roderic sauntered,
looking eagerly for the face his heart yearned to see.</p>

<p>Some few discreet people had left the capital and gone
away, pending the anticipated bombardment; but the
grand rush of panic stricken fugitives would not begin
until the first shell from the Yankee fleet came screaming
into town.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>It had been so on the previous occasion, and those who
for five hours that morning saw the steady, jostling, excited,
almost demoralized stream of humanity that poured
along the one road leading out of San Juan, many carrying
their most cherished household possessions upon their
backs, would never forget the remarkable spectacle.</p>

<p>Roderic's search was however, not without some result,
for he had several glimpses of his cousin Cleo in
the crowd.</p>

<p>She hung upon the arm of Captain Beven, and Miss
Becky was of course along.</p>

<p>Having heard so much of the gaiety to be found in
Porto Rico's capital the ladies had had curiosity enough
to come ashore.</p>

<p>Who could blame them, when listening to the delightful
strains of melody, and amid such enchanting and romantic
surroundings as the many tinted houses fronting
the grand plaza afforded!</p>

<p>Not Roderic, surely.</p>

<p>He thought it wise not to make his presence known, as
it might seriously compromise his safety in this hostile
city.</p>

<p>Nevertheless his eyes were frequently drawn toward the
trio, and somehow rested upon the face of his Virginia
cousin with a peculiar satisfaction.</p>

<p>If Cleo was not divinely handsome like Georgia she had
a fine figure and carried her head like an American queen,
so that any man might feel proud to claim kinship with
her.</p>

<p>Roderic noticed how eagerly she looked around.</p>

<p>At first he had the assurance to wonder whether she
could be seeking him in the crowd, and man-like was
beginning to even feel flattered at the idea when he noticed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
that those whom she scrutinized so eagerly were of the
gentler sex, wives and daughters of San Juan's better
class of citizens.</p>

<p>Then it flashed upon him that she hoped to discover
Georgia in the midst of the throng.</p>

<p>He dared not follow out this thought to its legitimate
conclusion, lest it make him appear egotistical even in
his own eyes.</p>

<p>That Georgia must have reached the city he knew full
well, for with his own eyes he had seen the Sterling Castle
in the harbor.</p>

<p>If that were not evidence quite sufficient here was Jerome
as big as life, sauntering about the plaza, the object
of adoration on the part of the whole female population,
and of malice, envy and black hatred on the part of the
military beaux who saw in this Adonis a rival to be feared.</p>

<p>Roderic mentally pictured the inevitable outcome and
in anticipation enjoyed Jerome's downfall.</p>

<p>"He will discover it a different matter flirting with the
daughters of Porto Rico. I am ready to swear my dandy
Lord High Admiral will ere long find himself ducked in
some fragrant frog pond, if no greater evil befalls him,"
was what Owen concluded.</p>

<p>Nor was he a particle sorry, since Jerome had long
played the heartless role of an adventurer, and many had
suffered because of his belief that the world owed him a
living.</p>

<p>The evening wore on, and Roderic began to imagine he
was doomed to disappointment.</p>

<p>Lovely faces he had seen, but not the one for which his
heart yearned.</p>

<p>Some of the ladies wore veils, their exceeding modesty
preventing them from showing their faces in such a mixed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
assemblage, a custom that undoubtedly descended from
royal blood desirous of being distinguished from the plebeian.</p>

<p>Still Roderic had full assurance that his eyes could discover
the girl he loved, even though she stood among a
score of veiled companions&mdash;there is an individuality in
the carriage, little peculiarities about the movement of
hands and head that appeal to the keen eye of Love, and
cannot be mistaken.</p>

<p>So Roderic, wise man, reasoned, as with a single glance
he decided that this one or that was not Georgia.</p>

<p>So others of his sex have decided in times past, and
mayhap paid the penalty of their folly.</p>

<p>As the secret agent was cruising around that side of the
plaza where the band had taken up its quarters, while
making a last selection, he received a shock without the
least warning by suddenly coming face to face with a
dashing looking Spaniard whose gay dress proclaimed
him some public performer.</p>

<p>Roderic gritted his teeth at sight of his yellow skinned
adversary of the past, for this was no other than Julio, the
handsome dancer of the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">bolero</i>, a man whose life had been
one long succession of conquests in the arena of Love,
and over whom half the town had at times gone wild.</p>

<p>He had <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">gitano</i> or gypsy blood in his veins, through his
mother, which doubtless accounted in a measure for the
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'diableric'"><i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">diablerie</i></ins> of his appearance, and his success among the fair
sex, for there is to many women a fascination in anything
bordering upon the tempestuous, the wild and eerie.</p>

<p>It was only natural that Roderic, coming thus upon the
man he had hated so bitterly in the past, should grind his
teeth and feel a mad desire to plant his fist square between
those black dare devil eyes that had wrought such accursed
mischief for years back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>Then he remembered that it was all a mistake&mdash;that he
had no valid reason for assaulting the idol of San Juan
save in the capacity of a general defender of the weaker
sex, a modern Don Quixote, and that would hardly be
politic.</p>

<p>Drawn by an attraction he could never explain, he
sauntered after the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">bolero</i> dancer, who had evidently
come out of some casino near by, after his performance
was done, in order to enjoy the music of the military band&mdash;come
out without changing his garments, which gave
him the picturesque swagger so admired among those of
his blood; and the red silk sash that was knotted at his
left hip, the ends trailing almost to the knee, did not
Roderic remember it well, and had he not once vowed to
some day use the same in strangling the gipsy dancer
with the devilish handsome face?</p>

<p>Pshaw! that was long ago, when he was a poor fool,
whom love had made insane.</p>

<p>Now he had learned his lesson well, and never again
would he allow such miserable suspicions to find lodgment
in his breast.</p>

<p>Georgia was as faithful as the stars, and the only reason
he felt a little bitterness toward this fellow was in
sympathy with the past.</p>

<p>As to jealousy, thank Heaven that evil weed had been
forever plucked out by the roots from the garden of his
heart, and&mdash;</p>

<p>But there was Julio, up to his old tricks, flirting with
one of Eve's daughters.</p>

<p>Roderic, still remembering the past, found himself indulging
in a wild hope that some indignant lover would
set upon the gypsy dancer and give him a taste of Spanish
vengeance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>Such however, did not happen.</p>

<p>The girl who had answered his signal with a wave of her
snowy kerchief soon joined him, and together they pushed
through the crowd as though heading for a street that
broke away from the plaza.</p>

<p>Roderic had been close at hand, and his eyes were not
closed&mdash;indeed, just about this time they seemed to be
unusually wide open, as though a sudden avalanche of
jealousy had swept over him.</p>

<p>It was not because the companion of Julio was veiled
that he watched her so eagerly, so breathlessly&mdash;other
women wore mantillas, and chose to conceal their patrician
faces from the common herd when walking the plaza.</p>

<p>What then?</p>

<p>Love is not blind&mdash;Roderic had just now been declaring
to himself that he would easily be able to pick Georgia out
from among a score of girls whose features were hidden
from view&mdash;and it was on this very account that he shook
from head to foot as though with the palsy.</p>

<p>Dead&mdash;that old demon Jealousy once planted in the human
breast is hard indeed to slay.</p>

<p>And Roderic again ground his teeth in fury, and followed
in the wake of Julio the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">bolero</i> dancer of San Juan
because this veiled senorita who took his arm and clung so
confidingly there as they dodged through the crowd had
apparently the familiar figure and actions of the girl he
loved, the girl he had once jilted on account of this self
same Spanish heart smasher&mdash;Georgia de Brabant, maid
of San Juan!</p>

<small>JULIO DECLARES FOR WAR.</small></h2>


<p>In this fair city of the Conquistadors, where Ponce de
Leon laid a foundation for the future Spanish colony,
there may have been men who for various causes felt the
heat of anger surging through their souls on this August
night in the year of our Lord 1898; but it is exceedingly
problematical whether one among them experienced such
a terrible volcano raging in their heart as did Roderic
Owen when the first suspicion burst upon him that Julio's
companion was the beautiful girl who had after estrangement
again promised to be his honored wife.</p>

<p>The shock almost took his breath away, it was so keen,
so cruel, and found him so unprepared.</p>

<p>Then came a revulsion of feeling&mdash;it could not be so&mdash;Georgia
was true, she was loving and faithful&mdash;this
was only a wretched coincidence&mdash;surely there were
women in San Juan who possessed figures on the same
order as hers, and who even made those familiar little
gestures&mdash;women were pretty much alike with regard to
such things, just as a dozen cats may all make the same
graceful leaps, together with the peculiar little motions so
characteristic the world over.</p>

<p>Still he followed Julio&mdash;for the life of him he could
not help that, no matter how thoroughly convinced he
might be that it was no affair of his&mdash;there was a terrible
fascination in the game, as though he were playing with
dynamite.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>And so the pendulum swung again, his eyes being still
glued upon the girl, once more he found himself the prey
to suspicions.</p>

<p>In vain he endeavored to throttle them, as his better
nature arose in arms&mdash;like Banquo's ghost they would not
down&mdash;every movement the girl made that reminded him
of Georgia was like a wicked stab in the region of his
heart, and when he saw the daring Julio pick up her kerchief
which had fallen from her hand, and press it to his
lips very cavalierly ere returning it, Roderic had a great
desire to rush upon the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">bolero</i> dancer and knock him down&mdash;indeed,
just at that minute he thought he had good
cause for hammering him in lusty Anglo Saxon style.</p>

<p>But Roderic was not jealous&mdash;oh! no, he had cast that
monster out of his heart for good, and meant to have no
more of him&mdash;only he had a very queer sensation seize
upon him, and felt as though it was only just and right,
both to Georgia and himself, that he should settle this
matter then and there.</p>

<p>This could only be done in one way, by looking upon the
girl's face.</p>

<p>He was firmly resolved to do this, come what might&mdash;Julio
would doubtless resent the impertinence, for Julio
was a fighter, having once been a <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">toreador</i> in the bull ring&mdash;what
of that, if only he could discover the truth one way
or the other?</p>

<p>A fellow in his frame of mind thinks little of danger,
the careless snap of his fingers perhaps.</p>

<p>What fools Cupid does make of men&mdash;even those who
would appear to be the best balanced go quite off the handle
when the little god finds lodgment in their bosoms.</p>

<p>At any rate Owen had now thrown away all other fancies
and was studiously following this couple as might an
Indian his intended prey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>Given a little time and he recovered, at least in a fair
measure, the coolness that usually characterized his actions.</p>

<p>He even lighted a cheroot, realizing that a Spaniard
such as he represented would appear singular without a
weed of some sort dangling from his lip.</p>

<p>Apparently Julio had lost all interest in the military
strains that throbbed and pulsated upon the night air&mdash;when
lovely women entered the game the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">bolero</i> dancer
threw other thoughts to the four winds&mdash;he might be a
lover of music but above all else he was a beau.</p>

<p>The couple evidently intended quitting the plaza, and
plunging down into one of the streets that would lead
them to that other section of town, where fashion never
troubled, and where the poorer element had their quarters&mdash;a
section that would especially appeal to the eye of
the artist and the newspaperman seeking quaint scenes for
the portrayal of Spanish characteristics.</p>

<p>Roderic was quite ready to follow&mdash;indeed, in his present
frame of mind it would not matter whither he went so
long as that lithesome figure tantalized him like a will-o'-the-wisp.</p>

<p>All he wanted was an opportunity to see her face, to
satisfy himself one way or the other, to quell this devilish
spirit raging in his breast, or failing that to let the fury
find an outlet.</p>

<p>One way or the other, however fortune might decide it,
he felt that a result must be reached.</p>

<p>Having taken the reins in his hands again and curbed
the unruly team that would have carried him headlong to
a speedy rupture of the peace, Roderic became outwardly
cool.</p>

<p>He aroused his old professional instincts to action, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
endeavored to forget that the case was more to him than
the usual run.</p>

<p>Thus he noticed that while Julio could never be anything
but a gallant and a beau, he did not attempt any
familiarities with his companion&mdash;that there seemed to be
a certain amount of respect on his part such as he seldom
showed toward those who had <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'succumed'">succumbed</ins> to the charm of
his fascinating presence.</p>

<p>Score one point in favor of Julio.</p>

<p>It might be of advantage when the curtain was rung up
for the final act, for should this desperate, jealousy-racked
lover who followed at his heels be given an opportunity to
get at that long throat of his, the Maccarena dancer would
have ample need of every prayer his guardian angel could
bring forth.</p>

<p>When the plaza with its gay crowds and its dashing
music had been left behind, Roderic knew his task had
assumed new risks.</p>

<p>The Spaniard is a suspicious mortal at his best, and
Julio had been embroiled in so many affairs with lovers,
perhaps husbands also, that he had to be constantly on the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">qui vive</i> lest one of these jealous minded gentry lie in wait
around a lonely corner, or creep up from behind, dagger
in hand.</p>

<p>When one plays such a game as that of this fascinating
beau, one must accept the consequences, no matter what
they entail&mdash;it is the price of popularity among the fair
sex.</p>

<p>Hence, it might be expected that after they had been
traversing these narrow thoroughfares for some little
time, Julio from frequent glances thrown over his shoulder,
would begin to notice how the shadow kept upon his
trail.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>This would arouse suspicion, and he might either vanish
suddenly from sight or else employ his popularity
among a certain class of men to bring Roderic into hot
water.</p>

<p>So far as this latter contingency was concerned, Roderic
cared little whether he were thrown up against a
dozen of the unwashed of San Juan, if he could only previously
have the blessed knowledge that his fears regarding
Julio's veiled companion were groundless.</p>

<p>In other words, such an assurance was of so great a
value in his eyes that he stood ready to accept the gravest
of danger with a smile on his face if only Georgia were
true.</p>

<p>He employed his usual tactics to prevent the other from
suspecting him, and being an adept at the business was
able to be out of sight on nearly every occasion when
Julio twisted that long neck of his for a glance toward the
rear.</p>

<p>This was all very well, but so far he had not advanced
a single step toward the elucidation of the mystery.</p>

<p>Well, patience&mdash;everything comes to him who waits.</p>

<p>Under ordinary conditions he could have applied this
time-worn but nevertheless true axiom to his own case,
just as he had done on many a previous occasion; but it
was a different matter when his eyes were eagerly watching
each movement of the girl, and in his heart he prayed
that the bitter cup might pass from him.</p>

<p>But something must be done.</p>

<p>At any moment Julio and his modest companion might
pass into one of the houses in this quarter, and the door
of which would consequently be shut and barred in his
face.</p>

<p>It would serve of little avail then for him to suddenly be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
electrified into action&mdash;he could pound upon the panels of
the sturdy door and demand admittance in the most lusty
of tones, but the only answer he might expect would be in
a shower of dirty water from the upper windows, a favorite
method in vogue among the lower classes of Spain
when the tax gatherers or some other unwelcome visitor
is knocking for admission.</p>

<p>Desperation often hurries a man to action&mdash;the need of
results one way or another spurs even a laggard in the
chase.</p>

<p>Having now determined to assume all the risks with
the expectation of placing them upon a single die, Roderic
changed his tactics.</p>

<p>It was his desire to overtake the dancer and by a bold
movement snatch the veil from the head of his companion.</p>

<p>Of course this would be the signal for war, since Julio
always had a chip upon his shoulder; but Roderic was
willing to accept the consequences, so long as the terrible
suspense was ended.</p>

<p>He began to slip up on the Spaniard, and with all his
faculties aroused Roderic was able to carry this part of his
programme out to perfection.</p>

<p>The streets were far from deserted&mdash;in places even
crowds could be seen, doubtless eagerly discussing the
great events overhanging San Juan, with an American
army landed on Porto Rico soil&mdash;for by this time the
dreadful news had come of Santiago's fall and the total
destruction of Cervera's fleet, so that Spanish respect for
Yankee valor was rising fast&mdash;first Dewey, then Sampson
and last of all Shafter, to be followed by Miles.</p>

<p>Owen was now but three paces behind the couple, and
could almost hear what they said, though their voices were
exceedingly low.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>His former diagnosis of the case was strengthened by a
closer survey&mdash;in height, and figure Julio's companion
was exactly a counterpart of Georgia&mdash;add to this the
peculiar little individualities such as usually mark a
woman's personality and the fact that this man had once
before come between them, what fault could be found with
Roderic for suspecting?</p>

<p>Well, the time had come for action.</p>

<p>That miserable gauze had baffled him long enough, and
he was determined to know the worst, Julio to the contrary.</p>

<p>Before the Spaniard could guess what was in the wind
Roderic had darted to the side of the girl, while his eager
hand reached out and seized upon her veil in a ruthless
grasp.</p>

<p>He heard her give a little scream as though terrorized
at his boorish act.</p>

<p>For this Owen, being chivalrous by nature of the blood
that had descended from Irish kings, hated himself most
earnestly&mdash;nevertheless this feeling did not prevent him
from following out the design that actuated his movements,
even as it had become a very part of his existence.</p>

<p>Though the fate of nations hung in the balance, yes,
even should his own life pay the penalty for his rashness&mdash;and
this is by all odds the highest stake a man can play&mdash;he
was resolved to settle this question once for all.</p>

<p>So he snatched away the veil.</p>

<p>He no longer breathed&mdash;in that dread moment when his
hopes of a whole future hung in the balance he seemed
actually to have been changed into stone.</p>

<p>So Lot's wife must have been petrified as she turned to
look back at the burning city.</p>

<p>When Roderic's eyes fell upon the face that had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
concealed by the veil they discovered rare beauty that was
now stamped with alarm, although some show of spirit
flashed from the great midnight eyes as indignation struggled
with maidenly fear.</p>

<p>But, praise be to Heaven, the girl though so beautiful
as to vie with his Georgia, was a stranger!</p>

<p>His demon was laid!</p>

<p>For that at least, thanks.</p>

<p>And now the consequences of his daring act must be
boldly met.</p>

<p>Apologies, however profuse, do not count for much
with hot blooded Spaniards, with whom an insult demands
a blow.</p>

<p>Knowing this Roderic fully counted on prompt action
on the part of the ex <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">toreador</i>.</p>

<p>Julio had met the rush of many a maddened bull in the
arena, and could himself do a little of that same when the
occasion arose.</p>

<p>He was naturally a trifle confused by the unexpected
move on Roderic's part, and this delay, short though it
was, gave the other a chance to pull himself together, to
put the girl out of his mind altogether and face Julio.</p>

<p>The latter was trembling with fury, and thus far weakened
his cause just when he needed all coolness and a clear
vision.</p>

<p>He rattled out a shower of expletives, each one of which
was as hot as a live coal; but even this did not appear to
annihilate his enemy.</p>

<p>Julio had not been entirely idle while thus giving vent
to his spleen&mdash;the glint of steel in his hand told Owen that
he had snatched out a ready dagger, possibly concealed in
his voluminous scarlet sash, and was ready to sheathe it
in the bosom of the unknown who had thrown down the
gauntlet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>Roderic saw the point, and had already gone him one
better, since he held a blade more than a match for Julio's
dagger, and moreover, knew how to handle it like a juggler
of India.</p>

<p>"Senor, it was a mistake&mdash;I am ready to make ample
apologies or fight&mdash;just as you decide," he said in Spanish.</p>

<p>The wolf would not be appeased by this sop.</p>

<p>He demanded blood.</p>

<p>It had been too grievous an insult to be forgiven, and
besides, what business has any self-respecting Spaniard
to forgive anyhow?</p>

<p>So Julio set out for war.</p>

<p>When any man on earth seeks a disturbance, and selects
an American citizen for the object of his assault, he usually
gets all he desires, and very frequently good measure,
pressed down and running over.</p>

<p>So Julio, the pet dancer and one time idol of the San
Juan bull ring, brushing his female companion aside almost
rudely, flung himself upon the stranger with the
ferocity of a panther, doubtless resolved to make him pay
for his audacity with his life.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<hr class="chap" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>
</div>

<h2 class="nobreak"><a name="Chapter_XIX" id="Chapter_XIX"></a>CHAPTER XIX.<br />

<small>BY WAY OF THE BALCONY.</small></h2>


<p>Julio had doubtless made other calculations during his
life, only to find them turn out Dead Sea fruit.</p>

<p>In this case his confidence was on a par with the natural
ferocity of his disposition, but as frequently happens,
he overshot the mark.</p>

<p>Roderic met his assault and went him one better&mdash;he
turned the Spaniard's eager blade aside with the quick
movement of one to the manner born.</p>

<p>No doubt Julio was surprised, but he never let anything
interfere with business.</p>

<p>A second rush, another rebuff.</p>

<p>This was growing monotonous&mdash;really, it began to look
as though the unknown cavalier might be playing with
him.</p>

<p>Nothing could arouse the devil in a Spanish heart
quicker than this suspicion.</p>

<p>Humiliation is to the proud don worse than any other ill
save death&mdash;relieve him from this indignity and you can
have all else.</p>

<p>So Julio, instead of taking warning from the ease with
which his assaults were turned aside, instead of calling
upon his patron saint for protection should this master of
the steel turn the tables and begin to assail him, only swore
the harder and went recklessly into the push.</p>

<p>Their little imbroglio had by this time attracted considerable
attention.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>Men called out to one another and came hurrying pell
mell to the scene&mdash;fond of cock fights and the meeting of
bull and <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">toreadors</i> in the arena, these fellows hailed a
street brawl as a special dispensation of Providence on
their behalf.</p>

<p>Already a ring was forming, a ring composed of dark
visaged men, some Spanish soldiers, others natives of the
noble city of San Juan, but all desirous of observing the
exciting drama that was being played as if especially for
their particular benefit.</p>

<p>All of which was bad for Roderic.</p>

<p>No matter what measure of success followed his engagement
with Julio, he was apt to find it a serious matter
to escape an encounter with these hangers on, whose
sympathies seemed to be with the dancer, judging from
the way in which his name was coupled with cries of direct
encouragement.</p>

<p>These same bravos urged Julio to make a third vicious
attack where prudence might have suggested that he cover
his weakness by falling back on the defense.</p>

<p>Roderic thought the farce had gone far enough&mdash;he was
desirous of leaving the locality ere it became too hot for a
man of his description; and besides, there was at least a
small chance that this impassioned athlete who struck out
so blindly, regardless of his own uncovered condition,
might inflict an accidental wound.</p>

<p>So he locked horns with the Spaniard and tripped him
up.</p>

<p>Julio never knew how it was done, for he was a pigmy
in the hands of a master.</p>

<p>He felt some tremendous power seize upon his person
so that he was borne irresistibly backward; at the same
time a sudden acute thrill of agony in his right wrist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
caused him to drop his knife as though it had been scorching
his fingers.</p>

<p>"Senor Julio," said the voice in his ear, "again I say it
was all a mistake&mdash;again I apologize for my hasty action.
You have defended your honor as became a true son of
Spain! There is no need of our seeking each other's life.
I am satisfied that I have met a brave man. Let us separate
in peace."</p>

<p>This was said with such fervor as became a loyal subject
of young Alphonso&mdash;it carried such a subtle vein of
flattery in the adroit words that even the fiery son of Mars
Julio was proving himself to be might have been mollified,
only that a discovery flashed upon him at this critical
juncture.</p>

<p>It was singular enough that he should set his eyes upon
an odd looking seal ring worn by his late antagonist, and
at this particular moment too of all times.</p>

<p>Julio had never forgotten that ring&mdash;indeed, he had
carried a rough impression of it upon his cuticle for a
week or more, as a gentle reminder of Roderic's ability
as a boxer, for it seems that the two rivals had indeed
once come to blows in those days of old, though separated
quickly by mutual friends.</p>

<p>However, such an impression is apt to be lasting&mdash;Julio
had seen the queer device of that signet ring many
times in his dreams, so that its unexpected appearance
just now and here was a rude shock.</p>

<p>Roderic saw the stare and while at first he could not
comprehend its import, when he too cast his eyes upon his
hand he remembered.</p>

<p>This was worse than he had expected&mdash;his identity
known to Julio what would prevent the hasty tempered
Spaniard, who still owed him a grudge for the blow received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
long ago, from publicly announcing his name to the
soldiers, who would pounce upon him like mad dogs.</p>

<p>He had expected at the worst to be treated as a Spaniard&mdash;now
the bubble had burst.</p>

<p>Was it to be flight?</p>

<p>Involuntarily he looked around him&mdash;the circle had
doubled, aye, even trebled, and to break through such a
compact mass would require the battering powers of a
giant.</p>

<p>What then?</p>

<p>Must he draw his revolver and simply sell his life as
dearly as possible?</p>

<p>It may be sweet to die for one's country, but most men
much prefer to live, especially when health and wealth
and honor are their inheritance by right of birth.</p>

<p>Roderic never felt less like giving up the ghost in all
his life than he did just then.</p>

<p>He had been far down below zero up to the moment
when he discovered that it was not Georgia who accompanied
Julio, and then of a sudden his spirits took a bound
that sent them away above fever heat; life assumed a rosy
hue, and happiness came again within his grasp.</p>

<p>A man of remarkable resources in emergencies, Roderic
felt no dismay paralyze his limbs when he discovered how
next to impossible it was that he make his escape through
the crowd.</p>

<p>There were other methods.</p>

<p>He had made it a rule in life never to depend wholly
upon one source of income&mdash;to avoid the mistake of putting
all his eggs in one basket.</p>

<p>Julio's scattered wits came back.</p>

<p>He even smiled, but there was a devil in that smirk; a
gleam in his eyes that told of gloating triumph.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>He had been easily beaten in the little game of the
knife, but there were still trump cards up his sleeve&mdash;he
laughed loudest who laughed last, and the time had
come for him to settle that long standing debt&mdash;the
scar of that wound had burned like wild fire every time
he looked at it, but it would cease to cry out for satisfaction
after this August night.</p>

<p>"Aha! Senor Owen, 'tis thus we meet again. You
thought this lady was your sweet Georgia&mdash;you took
your life in your hands when you set out to discover the
truth. Again you have crossed my path&mdash;this time it is
your last. I shall turn to these brave soldiers of Spain
and tell them who you are. They will be very affectionate
Senor Owen, they will love you so well that every
mother's son will want a portion of your precious body
to remember this night by. Have you anything to say
before I give the word?"</p>

<p>Roderic remembered how the judge when about to
pass sentence of death used words like this.</p>

<p>He was mute&mdash;it would avail nothing after all, and
he did not intend the Spaniard should have the satisfaction
of hearing him plead.</p>

<p>This trouble had come upon him through his own stupidity&mdash;the
burning in his chest, the unjust suspicions
that found lodgment in his mind urged him to take drastic
measures in order to learn the truth; and now that he
had found out just what it all meant he should not complain
if it came hard.</p>

<p>"Ho! he has lost his tongue&mdash;or his knowledge of the
noble Spanish language fails him. <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Por Dios!</i> we shall see
how he can be made to lift up his voice, to cry like a
dog, to squeal like the pig he is, to beg for mercy. Now
Senor Hero of the Knife, take notice that it is I, Julio,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
the Maccarena dancer and bull fighter who contemptuously
tosses you to the tender mercies of these gentlemen
as I would a yellow cur."</p>

<p>He turned to bawl his intelligence to the gaping crowd,
to proclaim the seeming dark faced stranger a wolf in
sheep's clothing, one of the hated Yengees who were
coming to destroy everything.</p>

<p>Before he could burst out with his startling tale however,
the girl who had accompanied him took a sudden
part in the drama, springing forward and catching hold
of his arm as she cried:</p>

<p>"You speak of Senor Owen, of Georgia&mdash;and a light
breaks in upon my mind. Julio, you <em>must</em> not go further&mdash;this
man should be safe from your malice. He has not
injured me&mdash;see, because of Leon I forgive him&mdash;I even
extend him my hand. Why not, when he loves the sister
and my heart belongs to the brother?"</p>

<p>Then Roderic's turn came to be amazed, for these
words informed him of a strange fact&mdash;he remembered
the story Georgia had told him of her brother, and how
Leon had been saved by the daughter of the Spanish
governor in charge of Morro Castle&mdash;fate had brought
him face to face with that devoted girl, and through her
might he not learn where Leon could be found?</p>

<p>Julio was the only obstacle, and Julio, having been several
times thwarted in his designs for a personal vengeance
upon this man who was so closely associated with
his past could not be easily placated.</p>

<p>A pretty woman might have considerable influence
over him under ordinary conditions, but just now he
wanted blood and was bound to have his desires fulfilled.</p>

<p>Accordingly he brushed the girl aside in an ugly manner
that betrayed his nasty temper&mdash;brushed her away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
as carelessly as one might dispose of a fly that persisted
in annoying the early morning nap of a sybarite.</p>

<p>Then he gave tongue, denouncing the other in unmeasured
terms as a Yankee spy come to wreck their
forts, to betray the city, to do anything and everything
that was dreadful in the eyes of good loyal Spaniards.</p>

<p>It made quite a striking scene, with the picturesque
Julio in his dashing garb thus violently shouting his
private opinion of Yankees in general and the one before
them in particular, while the beautiful daughter of Morro's
governor was clinging to his gesticulating arm and
endeavoring to overcome his mad language, the crowd
meanwhile beginning to shout answering cries that announced
their quick grasp of the situation.</p>

<p>Roderic would not soon forget that picture, if he lived
through the adventure.</p>

<p>Again he owed much to that love of fair play predominating
in the breast of gentle woman.</p>

<p>It had however, gone beyond any power on her part
to prevent an explosion.</p>

<p>If he escaped with a whole skin it must be through
his own exertions.</p>

<p>Fortunately he was able to grasp the situation and bring
order out of seeming chaos.</p>

<p>The one sweeping glance which he had taken around
had told him of an avenue where a desperate man could
find a chance.</p>

<p>As in many parts of San Juan the houses in this narrow
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">calle</i> were rich in the possession of balconies&mdash;Spaniards
would be lost without some such addition to
their homes, for the women live half of the time upon
these overhanging galleries.</p>

<p>The sound of angry voices in the street had brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
a number of people out, and they were curious spectators
of what followed.</p>

<p>Chance, or Providence, as you will, had taken Roderic
directly underneath one of these balconies.</p>

<p>By raising his hands above his head he could just
touch it.</p>

<p>To an agile man it was a small matter to give an upward
leap and secure a firm grasp above; nor did he
consider it any extraordinary feat to draw himself over
the railing after the manner of an athlete.</p>

<p>Cries of astonishment announced that his intention
had become known to the crowd, and almost paralyzed
them.</p>

<p>Mingled with these exclamations were shouts of rage
from those more disposed to action.</p>

<p>Julio, being the nearest was the first to make a spring
for the swaying body of the Yankee, but miscalculating
the pendulum movement of his body he was just in time to
receive the full impetus of his forward swing.</p>

<p>As a consequence he took a sudden tumble, bringing
up in the arms of the nearest soldiers.</p>

<p>Roderic had good intentions, and was not to be thwarted
by such minor disturbances.</p>

<p>This must be looked upon only as an incident, one of
those petty affairs which, when grasped in the general
run of events are to be throttled and cast aside.</p>

<p>He continued his movement as unconcernedly as though
it were a private instead of a public exhibition, which
feature was one of the strongest points in Owen's general
make up.</p>

<p>Several of the soldiers seemed to have some common
sense about them, or at least found inspiration in the
action led by Julio, for they too made a forward movement,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
intending to clutch hold of Roderic's swaying body
ere he could snatch it out of their reach.</p>

<p>That they were unsuccessful in this endeavor was not
so much their fault as their misfortune, since no one
could doubt the hearty enthusiasm with which they meant
to pull the Yankee's leg, an undertaking in general at
which Spanish regulars are usually proficient, especially
those who have attained officer's rank.</p>

<p>The girl came between them and their intended victim&mdash;she
had saved one Yankee from barbarous treatment
at the hands of her people, and having thus entered the
field as a champion of the oppressed, considered that she
might as well continue her labors.</p>

<p>Of course she could not effectually bar the enthusiastic
rush of the military forces, but for a few seconds she
served as an obstacle to their forward movement, and
even that brief time was enough for Roderic.</p>

<p>He completed his deal.</p>

<p>There was at least some satisfaction in the knowledge
that he stood temporarily out of the reach of those who
would destroy him.</p>

<p>A partial success brings with it new difficulties, new
problems to be solved, and one must be always ready to
grapple with the forces that are thrown to the front.</p>

<p>Owen did not consider that he had taken more than
the first step toward safety.</p>

<p>The wolves were just below, clamoring for his blood,
for his sudden flight had crystalized the various shouts
into one mad outburst of rage.</p>

<p>So far as he knew there was nothing to prevent some
of them from copying his example; he judged there must
be athletes enough in the throng for this business.</p>

<p>It was not his purpose to remain there upon the balcony,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
and meet all comers in a Greco-Roman wrestle for the
mastery.</p>

<p>He had started to escape, and it were useless lingering
longer in view of the rapidly growing throng.</p>

<p>One way was open to him, through the house to which
the balcony was attached.</p>

<small>A RENDEZVOUS AT THE TOBACCONIST'S.</small></h2>


<p>Some men have a passion for the uncertainties of
chance&mdash;they delight in wagering all they possess in the
shape of filthy lucre on the turn of a die.</p>

<p>Doubtless such inveterate gamesters might have found
some satisfaction in Roderic's position when, upon turning
from the friendly balcony he pitched himself and his
fortunes through the open window of the house.</p>

<p>All was uncertainty before him, and the seventh daughter
of a seventh daughter would have found it extremely
difficult to declare just what turn fortune's wheel was
about to take for him.</p>

<p>Roderic himself experienced no pleasure in this groping
in the dark, and would have been much better satisfied
could he have known just what lay before him.</p>

<p>However, there be times when one must accept philosophically
whatever favors the Fates choose to toss us
as they go swinging past&mdash;times when action is the only
resource left, and even at that one needs be wide awake
in order to take advantage of the opportunity.</p>

<p>When he burst into the apartment Roderic heard a
feminine shriek, but his only thought was a door of
some sort that would give him egress.</p>

<p>Fortunately he found this, more through good luck
than anything else.</p>

<p>It brought him to a hall.</p>

<p>Few though the seconds had been since his departure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
from the balcony, he could already hear the lusty blows
that were being delivered upon the door of the house,
which, unless of far better material than the average
doors in San Juan must speedily succumb before the vigorous
assault.</p>

<p>This meant that should he descend to the lower strata
in search of an outlet by way of court or garden or rear
exit of some sort he might be just in time to be overwhelmed
by the inflowing tide of eager hustling citizens
and soldiers.</p>

<p>At the same time it would never do to stand still and
lose what little advantage he had gained.</p>

<p>Perhaps even now some of his enemies were clambering
up to the balcony, since he had shown them the way.</p>

<p>Roderic had at least retarded pursuit from that quarter
by closing the door after quitting the apartment from
whence the dismal shrieks sounded in a high pitched
female voice, and the others might not prove so successful
in finding the opening as he had been.</p>

<p>He knew the peculiarities of Spanish houses.</p>

<p>In all probability there was some means of reaching
the roof, though he hardly expected to find an <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">azotea</i> with
its flowers and place for lounging, as in the better class
of more isolated dwellings.</p>

<p>Thus it came to pass that Roderic found himself crawling
through an opening at the top of a ladder, and thus
reaching the outer air.</p>

<p>His enemies were giving tongue with all the eagerness
of a pack of hounds, and the quick and thrilling pulsation
of blows announced that as yet the stubborn door had
failed to yield before their vigorous assault.</p>

<p>Just then, however, a crash followed by a chorus of
whoops and much laughter declared that success had
finally rewarded their efforts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>Immediately the house would be swarming with the
seekers after Yankee blood&mdash;like rats they would dart
hither and thither, leaving no stone unturned in their
eagerness to find that which was lost.</p>

<p>Roderic gave them his blessing.</p>

<p>He had surveyed the situation and laid out his plan
of action like a wise general.</p>

<p>It was necessary that he crawl over a number of roofs
before he could think of endeavoring to touch ground
again.</p>

<p>This he managed to accomplish without discovery from
the street, and on the whole he had reason to be thankful
that no curious eyes had fastened upon him from neighboring
buildings.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the searchers were having a merry time of
it in the house that had been made the object of their
assault&mdash;it sounded as if Bedlam had broken loose in
that quarter, and the shrieks of the terrorized maiden
lady formed but a small proportion of the chorus that
arose.</p>

<p>Roderic had found his opportunity to leave the roof
and reach a friendly deserted balcony.</p>

<p>From this to the ground was but a small undertaking,
and he managed to accomplish it with the utmost ease.</p>

<p>Thus triumph had followed his line of action.</p>

<p>He was now free to return to the plaza or seek the
humble abode of his friend, under the roof of which he
could rest in peace.</p>

<p>This should apparently have been his first thought, but
his action indicated that it was far removed from his
mind.</p>

<p>Not that he was in such a reckless mood as to invite a
fresh attack from these desperadoes of the San Juan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
streets&mdash;Roderic had simply become impressed with a
bright idea and was bent upon carrying it out.</p>

<p>He had not forgotten that a wonderful fortune placed
him in communication with the very girl whom he desired
to meet&mdash;the only one who could tell him where to find
Leon de Brabant, because she had fled with him and was
in all probability his wife.</p>

<p>Such a golden opportunity should not be neglected.</p>

<p>Fortune had been kind but the same chance might not
occur again.</p>

<p>To have a few words with her, to appoint a place of
future meeting, was the magnet that held Owen to the
spot even when ordinary discretion should have demanded
that he leave the dangerous neighborhood post haste.</p>

<p>It would not be the first time on record that a charming
woman's presence has nailed a man to danger's cross, and
so long as the world lasts will the story be repeated.</p>

<p>He did not believe there was much chance of his
identity being discovered, especially if he could avoid the
keen eye of that same Julio who had penetrated his disguise
before.</p>

<p>In appearance he did not differ to any material extent
from the majority of those to be seen in the streets of
San Juan.</p>

<p>Besides, all attention was at present centred on the
luckless dwelling that was being overhauled by a miscellaneous
assortment of soldiers and civilians. Some of
these enthusiasts had even clambered out upon the roof
and were eagerly searching for the fugitive in that
quarter.</p>

<p>Wise men have before this time been known to lock
the stable door after the horse was stolen.</p>

<p>Roderic was now among those who stood in the calle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
and chattering like a collection of magpies, kept their
regards fastened upon the wretched house whose balcony
had tempted the Yankee and thus precipitated trouble.</p>

<p>His one thought of course, was the girl&mdash;had she
flitted from the spot because the clamor had alarmed her
soul?</p>

<p>Perhaps she was not so unfamiliar with scenes of confusion,
since her father had been the governor of famous
old Morro Castle, under the walls of which many a remarkable
event has occurred since the days of the Virginius
affair, when American filibusters were shot down
by order of the Spanish authorities.</p>

<p>At any rate she was still there, watching the house
where so much clamor arose, twisting and untwisting her
little hands in nervous anxiety.</p>

<p>Thanks to Roderic's vandal hand her pretty face was
no longer screened by a veil, and more than one rough
soldier drank in the outlines of her charming features
with avidity.</p>

<p>She was evidently deeply concerned in the outcome of
the search.</p>

<p>Roderic should feel flattered at this evidence of approval
from so sincere a source.</p>

<p>It was no time, however, to indulge in any foolish speculations,
or allow his masculine vanity a chance to arise.</p>

<p>Julio was still on deck, and since his eyesight was apparently
as sound as ever, despite his rough treatment
at the hands of the Yankee, it would be a wretched mistake
to again come under his withering observation, for
on this occasion no friendly balcony might offer him an
asylum from the outstretched hands of the bolero dancer's
excited allies.</p>

<p>So Roderic approached the spot where stood the girl&mdash;he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
must exchange words with her, no matter what the
risk or the consequences&mdash;at least it was necessary that
some rendezvous be appointed where he could engage
her more fully in conversation.</p>

<p>With this set object in view he drew near, and watching
his opportunity whispered:</p>

<p>"Senorita&mdash;Leon's sister&mdash;turn this way!"</p>

<p>She must have heard him, for she immediately forgot
to watch the house that was being searched, and
fastened her eyes on him.</p>

<p>Roderic, fearing lest she might by means of some unwise
exclamation draw Julio's attention to him, had a
finger on his lips, indicating caution.</p>

<p>He saw her start and knew she immediately suspected
his identity.</p>

<p>Time was most valuable, and it was utterly out of the
question for him to learn what he desired while laboring
under such serious disadvantages.</p>

<p>Besides, it was folly to run any more risk than was
absolutely necessary, and with such a good hater as the
dashing <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">bolero</i> dancer only three yards away, every second
he remained there increased his danger.</p>

<p>At any rate he could not blame Leon for falling in love
with such a charming creature as the governor's daughter&mdash;Roderic
considered himself a fair judge of beauty,
even if he were not a connoisseur, and he saw a vision
of loveliness before him that might easily have disturbed
the sternest old anchorite.</p>

<p>Another thing&mdash;he discovered traces of distinct resemblance
between this girl and the handsome Julio, so
that a suspicion as to their possible relationship flashed
into his mind.</p>

<p>"Never mind how I escaped&mdash;I am here to speak to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
you. My object in entering this city is to find Leon&mdash;you
must take me to him&mdash;it is the price of my happiness
with Georgia&mdash;when and where can I see you again&mdash;appoint
a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rendezvous</i>, I pray you."</p>

<p>This is what he said hastily almost in her pretty ear&mdash;she
was quick of comprehension, and by the look upon her
face he knew she had grasped the situation.</p>

<p>One glance she shot toward Julio, who just at the
moment <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'semed'">seemed</ins> deeply engrossed with the antics of the
men who were running over the roofs like a lot of monkeys.</p>

<p>Roderic pressed even closer, eager to hear what she
might say, since it concerned his future state as connected
with Georgia.</p>

<p>"At Senor Pedro Sanchez the tobacconist, on the Grand
Plaza&mdash;at eight o'clock&mdash;to-morrow&mdash;<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Madre de Dios</i> protect
you, senor! Do not longer delay!"</p>

<p>It was enough.</p>

<p>He knew he could find the place and keep the appointment.
Her warning was well timed too, for just as he
turned away Julio came to her side.</p>

<p>It was a rare piece of good fortune that had kept him
away thus long.</p>

<p>Julio seemed uneasy and suspicious&mdash;he even glanced
sharply at every one near by as though some inward
monitor warned him he was being outgeneraled.</p>

<p>The bystanders were to all appearances quite innocent
of wrong intentions, and he could not run after the man
who walked away so composedly, demanding that he then
and there give an account of himself&mdash;those in whose
veins bounds the hot blood of Spain stand no such peremptory
challenges as that, and the answer just as likely
as not would be the drawn arm, the glint of polished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
steel, the thud of a <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">cuchillo</i> striking home&mdash;ugh! he
wanted not of that sort.</p>

<p>Oh! yes, Julio knew all about this, for his education
while neglected in some other particulars was quite up
to date when it came to the stir and danger of war&mdash;he
had been through many a little engagement himself
during his checkered career, and knew just what he
would do under similar conditions.</p>

<p>Wherefore his exceeding caution.</p>

<p>It was the development of this trait that had given
Julio so long a lease on life in spite of his many entanglements.</p>

<p>Roderic now made it his business to quit the stirring
locality.</p>

<p>Little he cared to what lengths the mob went in their
vigorous search&mdash;they could tear the old town wide open;
but he had good reason to doubt whether they would receive
any reward, since it was himself they sought, and
he had high hopes of continuing to avoid their clutches.</p>

<p>The morning would find him on the plaza, with his
eyes fastened upon the tobacconist's jaunty little shop&mdash;did
he not know it well, for had he not many a time in
the past loitered in that same queer establishment, selecting
prime weeds from Senor Pedro's carefully arranged
stock, and discussing the affairs of the universe
with the white bearded philosopher who guided the destinies
of the rendezvous where men met and formed plans
and sought advice.</p>

<p>Ah! that was in the good days of long ago, before
San Juan had heard the deep growl of hostile Yankee
guns, before it was a capital offense to be known as an
American in Porto Rico&mdash;halcyon days when Love's
brush painted all around him a rosy hue, when life's
horizon knew no cloud.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>Since then he had suffered much, but thank heaven
it seemed as though the old state was about to once more
come upon him, and gold is doubly precious when refined
by fire.</p>

<p>The clamor and confusion was left behind as he
passed along various narrow streets, heading once again
toward the Plaza Cristobal Colon.</p>

<p>Minor things attracted him as in the happy past when
he knew no care&mdash;he even stopped where the sound of
guitars announced some entertainment under a canvas
shelter, and found his old acquaintances the gypsies in
their weird dance, dark skinned sons and daughters of the
warm Sierra Morena valleys.</p>

<p>Other scenes, common enough in this section of the
capital, drew his attention, and he found a peculiar joy
in watching two humble lovers, he with his sturdy arm
about the maiden's waist, strolling along just beyond.</p>

<p>Well satisfied with what had come to pass on this
particular night Roderic reached the cottage home of
his Cuban friend, and giving the signal knock was admitted.</p>

<p>Wearied in body yet with a mind relieved from all
care he sought and found rest in sleep.</p>

<p>With the coming of morning he was astir.</p>

<p>Every one rises early in San Juan, for there is life
and vigor in the bracing air, a tonic that becomes a
necessity to these people who live in a semi-tropical region
that has never known frost, and where midday is stifling.</p>

<p>Roderic had more than ordinary reasons for rising
early on this morning&mdash;one can look with considerable
pleasure upon that day whose dawn promises to usher in
the greatest blessing on earth for him, and this was the
extent of his hopes in connection with the governor's
daughter who had saved Leon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>When he issued forth he found that an unusual stir
pervaded the town.</p>

<p>Some military movement was on the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tapis</i>, and he presumed
that it could only be one of considerable importance,
judging from the bustle that pervaded even this
portion of the town.</p>

<p>Maneuvers were usually confined to those sections
where the streets were wider and a better class of citizens
could enjoy the brilliant spectacle; for no soldiers like
appreciation more than those of Spain.</p>

<p>Curiosity might have led Roderic to look into this
matter a little more deeply, but just at present he had
his time well occupied, and besides, it mattered very little
to General Miles what the soldier garrison of San Juan did,
since they were doomed to capture at no distant day,
squirm and struggle as they pleased.</p>

<p>Breakfast first, and this he secured at a cafe where
many men had gathered to drink their coffee and talk
over the exciting events about to transpire in the Antilles.
They had no hesitation in expressing sympathy with the
American arms for this was not Cuba&mdash;even the Spanish
soldiers in Porto Rico had a leaning toward the Yankees&mdash;there
was far less bitterness shown than in Havana,
for the people were more independent. The sensation of
liberty was in the air, and men seemed to feel the new
strength that was soon to make them a section of the
Western giant&mdash;they had known for some time what Destiny
had in store for Porto Rico, and patiently awaited
the glorious dawn of that blessed day, instead of the
useless struggles of years, that would sap their powers,
and blight their beloved land, even as Cuba had been, with
the incendiary's torch and the bushwhacker's rifle.</p>

<p>The day for their reward was coming, and once the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
stars and stripes had been planted on Spain's colony's
sacred soil, it was there to stay, whether that land be
Cuba, Porto Rico, the Ladrones or the far away Philippines.</p>

<p>It was now near the hour when he had agreed to meet
the girl, so Roderic made his way toward the plaza.
While this place lacked much of the charm that is always
associated with myriads of lights, moving gayly dressed
throngs and stirring open air concerts, it was full of
people about this hour of the day since the summer sun
would chase people indoors long before noon.</p>

<p>He came down in the quarter where the quaint little
shop of the tobacconist was to be found, and kept his
eyes eagerly on the alert for a figure that would, as he
remembered, remind him of Georgia's.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<hr class="chap" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>
</div>

<h2 class="nobreak"><a name="Chapter_XXI" id="Chapter_XXI"></a>CHAPTER XXI.<br />

<small>THE MONSTER COMES AGAIN.</small></h2>


<p>At first Roderic only met with disappointment, for
while people were continually passing, and some even
went in and out of Senor Pedro's little shop, none upon
whom his observation fell seemed to bear any resemblance
to the one for whom he sought.</p>

<p>This suspense only increased his eagerness.</p>

<p>No doubt it would have been stronger had he expected
to meet Georgia; but his business on this August morning
was closely connected with her after all, since in the
governor's daughter he saw, not a beautiful girl who had
fascinated him but a messenger bringing hopes of a bright
future.</p>

<p>For once Roderic was unconscious of the fact that
he seemed to be an object of deep interest to some member
of the fair sex seated on a balcony not far away.</p>

<p>She had her face partially concealed by the filmy lace
so thoroughly a part of a Spanish woman's toilet, and
this she manipulated in such a way that even a dear friend
passing by might never have suspected her identity.</p>

<p>Something about Roderic appeared to have attracted
her attention&mdash;perhaps it was the fact of his haunting
that immediate vicinity, perhaps his manly showing that
appealed to her heart, it might even be possible that she
believed she knew him.</p>

<p>Many opportunities were given for a careful examination
of his walk and carriage, and the more this unknown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
senorita looked the deeper grew her interest until at last
she exclaimed softly, yet with no little rapture:</p>

<p>"<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Madre de Dios!</i> it is no other than he&mdash;there cannot
be two men so fashioned by Heaven, so perfect in figure,
so brave in movement, so altogether charming; but what
does he seek&mdash;what the object of his tramp back and
forward?"</p>

<p>Evidently milady of the balcony entertained the warmest
affection for the party whose identity she thought she
had discovered under Roderic's disguise.</p>

<p>Her curiosity being aroused she began to cast about for
some object that would explain this sentinel tramp of the
man on the plaza.</p>

<p>It was not long before she decided that his interest
was wholly taken up with the little shop of the plaza
tobacconist.</p>

<p>Now doubtless the quaint establishment of Senor Pedro
was a gem in its way, and worthy of considerable notice&mdash;she
chanced to know it well and that many lovers were
wont to designate it as a point near which they appointed
a rendezvous&mdash;indeed, certain tender memories even made
her gentle bosom heave, and a sigh escaped her lips as
she looked again at the shop.</p>

<p>But there must be some other reason why this man
of the striking figure, and walk so energetic, so different
from the usual run of Spaniard or native Porto Rican
should haunt the vicinity.</p>

<p>"Ah! he expects some one&mdash;he has friends in San Juan
he said&mdash;it is a rendezvous for business. How little does
he dream that eyes filled with tender love are on him.
I do not think I can much longer refrain from letting him
know&mdash;our old signal, ah! how he would hasten thither
did I but dare to give it. The temptation is irresistible.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Carramba!</i> I love him so, why should I resist since he is
mine. How he will turn and look around, and when I
make one beckoning movement, ah, me, with the speed
of love he will fly to me. All else is forgotten&mdash;my
hungry heart clamors for the sound of his voice, which
is life and light to me. Yes, I will cast prudence to the
winds&mdash;the spell of his presence is over me&mdash;to feel the
warm clasp of his hand, to hear his voice that has haunted
my dreams tell me again how he loves only me&mdash;ah, that
will be Heaven on earth. And to think I can enter Paradise
just by one little bird whistle&mdash;ah! what delightful
suspense while I linger and anticipate; but it is cruelty to
him I love. So then, the signal that has often in the past
called him to my side."</p>

<p>It chanced, however, that whatever this signal may
have been she did not make it just then.</p>

<p>On the contrary, bending forward she watched the man
on the plaza with new interest, a different feeling having
crept like an icy hand into her heart.</p>

<p>There was reason.</p>

<p>Roderic's slow saunter had become a quick walk, and
in his whole attitude could be seen an eagerness that animated
his frame&mdash;in a word he had become electrified.</p>

<p>No signal had been given, but his eyes had fallen upon
a veiled female figure that came along the plaza.</p>

<p>They would meet in front of Senor Pedro's establishment,
just as scores of couples had met time without
mind.</p>

<p>This fact appeared to stamp itself upon the mind of
the looker on&mdash;it was apparently one of the first things
she thought of.</p>

<p>"The same place that was so sacred to me, and he
goes to greet another there. Am I awake or is this some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
terrible dream. See, they meet, he holds out his hand&mdash;how
eagerly he takes hers and raises it to his lips. And
she&mdash;I cannot see her face, but what is this&mdash;so like in
figure in her walk&mdash;surely my soul remains here on the
balcony while my human form has gone to meet its king.
And yet&mdash;and yet, how can it be so? Would to Heaven
she might but remove her veil if but for one moment that
I might see whether I dream or really see him with another.
Could she have heard my wish&mdash;she raises her
hand, she brushes aside the veil as though he but had to
ask the favor. Be still, treacherous, sorely wounded
heart. What beauty, what ravishing charms be in that
face. And how I could hate it if, perdition take the
thought, it has come between <em>us!</em>"</p>

<p>All desire to give the signal had now fled.</p>

<p>She simply crouched there in the balcony with a bruised
heart, smothering her groans, and watched the couple
sauntering about the plaza.</p>

<p>Roderic, poor fellow, utterly unconscious of the fact
that he was giving pain to a heart that yearned for him,
continued to promenade with the governor's daughter.</p>

<p>There were others on the plaza, and the couple attracted
no particular attention save from this one interested
quarter.</p>

<p>Of course he was deeply interested in what his companion
was saying.</p>

<p>It had a very intimate association with the happy and
glorious future he had mapped out for himself and the
girl he loved.</p>

<p>Perhaps his manner appeared devoted according to the
film that jealousy cast upon the eyes of she who watched
from above.</p>

<p>But surely Roderic did not mean it to be so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>The governor's daughter came to him as a messenger,
an angel bearing good news, and as a gentleman how
could he be other than attentive&mdash;who could be a boor
when his companion was a pretty woman?</p>

<p>Alas! he little suspected how in the eager effort to
further the cause of his happiness he was heaping up coals
of fire with which to inflict torture upon himself and she
whom he loved.</p>

<p>When all had been told and arrangements made for
a future meeting, the girl left him.</p>

<p>Roderic had imbibed some of the courtly ways of these
people, and it was not at all strange that he should again
raise the hand she gave him to his lips.</p>

<p>The action however, might be misconstrued.</p>

<p>He had heard much that interested him, and besides
found desperate work cut out ahead, if he hoped to save
Leon, who was in deadly danger.</p>

<p>Hence, when once more alone he thought to indulge
in a cigar so that he might consider the whole case, and
form plans for the immediate future. To those who are
accustomed to the solace of a weed the necessity of this
step can be understood and needs no apology.</p>

<p>Roderic, having a glorious destiny opening before
him, and being in the possession of unbounded health
and strength, enjoyed the first part of that cigar immensely.</p>

<p>He never knew what the balance was like.</p>

<p>For a shock came upon him, a shock that was entirely
unexpected, and which left him so stunned that a Wheeling
stogie would have appeared as a prime Havana in
his estimation.</p>

<p>What more could be said?</p>

<p>As he turned in his walk he suddenly discovered a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
veiled figure approaching&mdash;walk and figure declared that
it could be no other than the governor's daughter&mdash;she
had forgotten something and had returned to tell him.</p>

<p>Roderic's step quickened as he hastened to meet her
now faltering advance.</p>

<p>Naturally enough he smiled pleasantly&mdash;why not, under
such conditions?</p>

<p>Alas! that one's motives may be misconstrued&mdash;that a
fever raging in the heart may distort even the most common-place
action.</p>

<p>"Ah! you have relented&mdash;you will not tear yourself
away so soon&mdash;you have thought of something else that
may have an importance bearing upon our plans&mdash;plans
that if properly carried out mean happiness for both of
us. Yes, I rejoice to see you return, as I was in something
of a dilemma and perhaps you can help me out."</p>

<p>He had extended his hand impulsively but she refused
to see it.</p>

<p>"You are not angry, senorita&mdash;I have not offended you
in any way, I trust: I should never forgive myself if it
were so," he said.</p>

<p>Perhaps the anxiety in his tone was strong&mdash;at any rate
she seemed to tremble with half suppressed emotion and
shrank back.</p>

<p>Roderic became more impressed and concerned.</p>

<p>"You do not speak&mdash;you <em>are</em> offended, clown that I am
to have said or done something unwittingly that has hurt
your feelings. Senorita, pray pardon me&mdash;restore me
to your favor, I beg."</p>

<p>While he was thus apologizing, for what he himself did
not have the least idea, Roderic could not refrain from
thoughts of an altogether different nature, and which
must have run something in this vein:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now bless my soul if I know what to do in such a
case. Ten minutes ago she left me full of spirits and
as warmly disposed as one could wish&mdash;now she returns
and deigns not to even accept my hand. Duse take it,
women are all alike, mysteries to me. What have I done
in the interim&mdash;lighted a cigar and wrapped myself up
in thought. It's a good enough cigar, too," casting a
dubious glance at the weed as if some vague and monstrous
suspicion had arisen in his mind that the inoffensive
weed might have something to do with the matter.</p>

<p>Then light broke in upon him&mdash;it came from her.</p>

<p>"I do not speak, you say&mdash;it is because I am overcome
with surprise, mortification, despair&mdash;because I have
learned that you have deceived me, that you are a traitor!"
came from under the veil.</p>

<p>Roderic was almost paralyzed at first.</p>

<p>The figure, the walk might be that of the governor's
daughter, but the voice was no other than Georgia's.</p>

<p>Over his face flashed a look of joy, for his heart leaped
to meet its mistress.</p>

<p>"Georgia&mdash;is it you&mdash;I thought, I believed&mdash;"</p>

<p>She stopped his stammering exclamations of mingled
delight and explanation.</p>

<p>"I do not care to hear what you would say, Senor
Owen. After this day, this hour, we must meet as
strangers," she said, with difficulty controlling her emotion.</p>

<p>"This is cruel&mdash;you cannot mean it, when I am risking
my life here in your cause. You say that but to prove
me, Georgia."</p>

<p>"I mean every word of it. Think not I have no eyes,
Senor Owen&mdash;I have seen all. Doubtless your risk has
been considerably ameliorated by the pleasant company
you are forced to seek."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>Then he knew what she meant.</p>

<p>The shoe was on the other foot&mdash;it had come her turn
to show jealousy.</p>

<p>"Georgia, I can explain everything&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I refuse to listen, knowing how weak I should be under
the sound of your voice."</p>

<p>"I swear you wrong me."</p>

<p>"Senor, I saw everything&mdash;you might tell me a wonderful
tale, but I could never forget."</p>

<p>"Georgia, for the last time I implore you to give me
a hearing&mdash;that girl&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stop, do not dare to mention her to me, sir. I refuse
to hear even her name."</p>

<p>She had thrown back her veil, showing her indignant
face, her blazing midnight eyes and Roderic, who had
never yet seen her in this mood was appalled.</p>

<p>"Since you command it I shall say no more. Once I
condemned you unheard and God knows I paid dearly
for the error. Now, with even less reason you have accused
me, and refuse to let me explain. Very good,
senorita, I too can be proud&mdash;it must be you who bridges
over this abyss if it is ever accomplished. Meanwhile
I shall go my way and find Leon, thanks to the lady you
have so bitterly condemned."</p>

<p>He turned with a bow and left her there.</p>

<p>Roderic was cut to the quick to think that she could
suspect him of being unfaithful after all he had given
up for her sake.</p>

<p>It might seem as though he would have great patience
with one whom he loved and who was passing through
the same bitter error that had once engulfed him.</p>

<p>Alas! human nature is not so constituted.</p>

<p>His pride was touched and he believed he had
gone far enough to explain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>Ten words, had she allowed him to say them, would
have removed the cause for doubt and suspicion; but as
imperiously as a young queen, she had forbidden him
to speak, and therefore like a lamb led to the altar he
would not open his mouth again to plead his cause.</p>

<p>The hour would come, when Leon was restored to her,
and she saw in his devoted wife the lovely woman whose
association with Roderic had so aroused her jealousy&mdash;that
hour would witness his triumph&mdash;it would balance
the account and thus they could start afresh.</p>

<p>So Roderic indulged in philosophical reflections to
bolster up his courage.</p>

<p>But he smoked no more that morning.</p>

<p>Georgia had stood there where he had left her as
though incapable of action&mdash;once she stretched out a
hand after his retreating form, and a low cry bubbled
from her lips, now hidden by the veil; but by no movement
or outcry did she attempt to recall him.</p>

<p>"It is better that I should die than live to be deceived.
He would explain, but how could my eyes deceive me?
And she was so beautiful, when he kissed her hand. Oh!
it was cruel, and he, my Roderic is like all men, a perfidious
monster. I may not forget him but I shall try
to learn to <em>hate</em> him."</p>

<p>Evidently she believed she had a big contract on hand.
Then her better nature, urged by the love that nestled in
her heart, had an inning.</p>

<p>"He kissed her hand&mdash;true, yet since when has that
become a crime that men should be condemned because
of it? Last night did not General Parrado raise my
hand to his lips respectfully. I wonder whether he was
pilloried for it this morning by the Lady who Must be
Obeyed. What did he say&mdash;"find Leon, thanks to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
lady you have so bitterly condemned." Have I done
wrong&mdash;is he still true? Oh! weak heart, how you cling
to your idol&mdash;oh! yearning soul, with what power may
I tear your clinging tendrils away from the oak around
which they have grown? It will be death to the vine&mdash;death
to poor wretched me."</p>

<p>She returned slowly to the house, hoping that Roderic
would repent his rash resolve and return to give her another
chance.</p>

<p>But alas, he came not, for the wound was too fresh,
and the salt that had been rubbed into it smarted too
fiercely.</p>

<p>Upon the balcony Georgia spent all of the day save
the hours for <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">siesta</i>&mdash;she watched eagerly those who
went up and down the plaza, yet no sign came from the
one beloved.</p>

<p>By degrees the full realization of her desolation came
upon her.</p>

<p>"I have chased him from me&mdash;with scorn and bitterness
have I sent my Roderic away, and he will come no
more. Woe is me, wretched Georgia. He swore by the
stars, by everything he held sacred, yes, even by the
grave of his sainted mother that he loved only me. And
I have refused to hear him. He will never seek me again.
Night's shades are falling and without his assistance I
must venture into the jaws of danger&mdash;for Leon's sake.
Heaven forgive me and crush my haughty heart because
it has made him suffer. Heaven give me a chance to
atone for my pride, for the insult put upon him."</p>

<p>And thus lamenting the prettiest girl in all San Juan
saw the lights begin to gleam in the island capital.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><a name="Chapter_XXII" id="Chapter_XXII"></a>CHAPTER XXII.<br />

<small>TO THE OLD FORTRESS.</small></h2>


<p>There was one remarkably good trait about Owen&mdash;he
had a powerful will, and when he chose could concentrate
all his abilities upon a certain subject, to the exclusion
of everything else.</p>

<p>It pleased him to nurse his grievances for a time&mdash;what
badly used biped would not be addicted to the same
luxury.</p>

<p>Then, with a mighty upheaval he cast the whole load
from him.</p>

<p>The public weal demanded his full attention and private
woes must take a back seat.</p>

<p>For the present, therefore, he effaced cruel Georgia
from his mind, and resolutely set his shoulder to the
wheel.</p>

<p>Roderic was himself again, calm, shrewd and with a
contempt for danger that might take him to the border
land of reckless endeavor, though he usually knew how
to check this in good time to make it a servant rather
than a master.</p>

<p>The day had gone.</p>

<p>Alas! he had thought to mark it down with a white
cross as one that would take him a long step nearer Elysium;
but instead it was to be distinguished by a red
mark.</p>

<p>Was there a fatality in his love for Georgia?</p>

<p>Were they doomed never to know happiness?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>That was the last uneasy thought that came to him ere
he shut the whole scene out of his mind, as a rain squall
envelopes the landscape.</p>

<p>It was no ordinary affair which Roderic now took up;
at least it promised to afford considerable danger, and
would call for a display of energy on his part, of no
mean calibre.</p>

<p>He went into it with a grim feeling such as he could
not remember experiencing on any previous occasion.</p>

<p>Perhaps this was caused in part by the dead weight
upon his mind, for it was singular that he should be placing
his life in jeopardy in order to please a girl who had
jilted him, cast him aside like a worn-out glove.</p>

<p>It added to the piquancy of the thing, but Roderic could
not say he hoped for a repetition.</p>

<p>The governor's daughter had given him strange information
about Leon.</p>

<p>This brother of Georgia seemed fated to see the inside
of more than one Spanish prison. His experience in
Morro Castle, from whence he escaped through the
assistance of the girl who had fallen in love with him,
one would think must have been quite enough in that
line; but he had somehow or other again fallen into the
hands of his foes.</p>

<p>Thus it happened that he had been in the San Juan
prison, condemned to exile, on the morning of the memorable
twelfth of May, when about daybreak Sampson's
powerful fleet opened on the forts and were in turn
barked at by the bold Spanish gunners, who showed
their bravery if they did no damage.</p>

<p>It happened that the prison was probably the most exposed
building in the city, lying as it did between the fleet
and the pulverine, the gallery of it fronting on the harbor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>Without warning a shell exploded in the wall, and
that side of the building became a wreck.</p>

<p>Bricks and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">debris</i> flew in every direction, and all who
were in the apartment with Leon found themselves on
their backs.</p>

<p>Such a chorus of frightened shouts went up&mdash;demoralization
reigned supreme.</p>

<p>But Leon, who had not been seriously injured, was
quick to see that once again the Providence that seemed
to watch over his fortunes had interposed in a miraculous
manner to save him&mdash;the Yankee shell in its inquisitive
search for the most available Spanish property
to destroy had torn out almost one side of the prison, and
through the gaping aperture freedom beckoned.</p>

<p>So he had crawled out, covered with dust and bearing
several wounds where the flying bricks had come
in contact with his person.</p>

<p>Two days later he had been again seized, being betrayed
by a negro in whom he and his lovely wife had
unwisely placed confidence.</p>

<p>From that day on he had been kept in close confinement,
and finally again brought to trial. This time conviction
was followed with a still more severe penalty&mdash;he was
doomed to be shot.</p>

<p>Roderic learned the whole story&mdash;it would not pay to
take time to give the details&mdash;one who had sought the
governor's daughter's hand and been coldly received had
been elevated to a high military position in Porto Rico,
and found himself in a way to visit his miserable displeasure
upon the man who succeeded where he failed.</p>

<p>Perhaps he hoped to win the widow&mdash;Heaven only
knows, for some knaves have assurance enough to offer
a hand red with a husband's blood to the heart-broken
beauty who mourns his loss.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>At any rate this was the situation that demanded Roderic's
attention.</p>

<p>It was serious enough to call for determined effort on
his part.</p>

<p>True, he had never as yet met Leon, but somehow a
deep interest in the young Porto Rican's fate had taken
possession of him&mdash;when a man has supped many times
with adventure, he experiences a sympathetic feeling for
one who had also rubbed up against the hard side of
life.</p>

<p>Besides, Leon was <em>her</em> brother, and anything that was
in the remotest degree connected with Georgia appealed
to his chivalrous nature.</p>

<p>Last of all he had promised, aye, taken a solemn vow,
that he would find Leon, and this being interpreted meant
that should the young man be in a predicament of any
sort it would be his business and his pleasure to succor
him if such a thing lay in the bounds of human <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'posibility'">possibility</ins>.</p>

<p>Roderic had means of communication abroad.</p>

<p>A cablegram sent from Europe to a certain correspondent
in New York would be immediately transmitted to
another point in the West Indies, possibly San Domingo,
where the message would be put in the form of a letter
and sent to an imaginary Spaniard at San Juan.</p>

<p>Thus it happened that when he returned to the humble
roof that sheltered him, when evening drew on apace, he
found there a well thumbed missive which upon being
hastily opened contained this sanguine message:</p>

<p>"Have broken the bank at Monte Carlo. Will sail to
join you to-morrow."</p>

<p>Roderic laughed&mdash;he could not help it.</p>

<p>Darby had longed for a chance to try some peculiar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
combination he had hatched up upon the great gambling
centre, and this opportunity had appeared a wonderful
favor.</p>

<p>The chance was one in a million, yet it had actually
come to pass.</p>

<p>"I've heard the song about the man who broke the bank
at Monte Carlo, but never dreamed I would in any way be
instrumental in sending a representative there who would
do that same thing. Good for Darby, lucky fellow. By
the way, I wonder does that charming adventuress sail
with him&mdash;if so the chances are ten to one the fortune he
has won will not be in his possession long. Well, it must
be some time before he can join me, unless he manages to
board some Spanish steamer, taking the guise of a don;
and such vessels are exceedingly scarce on the high seas
now."</p>

<p>With that he lighted the paper and destroyed every
trace of Spanish chirography.</p>

<p>Once again he turned his full attention toward the rescue
of Leon.</p>

<p>Other elements were working toward that same end,
yet of this fact Roderic was of course profoundly ignorant,
and he labored on as though only through his endeavors
could the man condemned to be shot find a chance
for safety.</p>

<p>He had laid out his plans after the manner of a general
who goes to war.</p>

<p>Every little detail had to be looked into, and arrangements
made whereby a secondary battery could be brought
to bear, should the first fail to prove effective.</p>

<p>It was perhaps unfortunate that he would have to work
single handed, because he knew of no one in all San Juan
whom he could thoroughly trust in this matter of life and
death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>How he missed Darby&mdash;what a tower of strength the
man would have been to him just now.</p>

<p>Roderic however, never sighed for the moon; when he
could not have what he wanted he was philosophical
enough to drop the subject and content himself with what
he had.</p>

<p>The man with whom he had taken up his temporary
abode in San Juan was a faithful fellow, but lacked the
ability to serve him in this emergency when so much depended
on the move of a hand or the exact carrying out of
prearranged plans.</p>

<p>Roderic had indeed asked numerous questions, and the
information received, added to what he already knew from
personal experience, placed him in a position to "carry the
war into Africa."</p>

<p>Leon was confined in an old fortress that presented a
most picturesque appearance by moonlight, and would
have made an excellent subject for amateur photographers,
yet possessed few elements of modern strength.</p>

<p>Like St. John's church, it had received a few compliments
from Sampson's fleet, which gaping apertures,
together with accumulated <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">debris</i>, only served to add to
the picturesque confusion.</p>

<p>Roderic had prowled about this neighborhood considerably
during the day, careful not to attract attention, yet
with the desire to learn the actual lay of the land, so that
even under cover of darkness he would be able to move
with at least a fair degree of certainty.</p>

<p>It presented a good view of the bay and harbor, the governor
general's palace on the point and the few vessels in
the harbor, chief of which was the Spanish torpedo boat
destroyer Terror.</p>

<p>Roderic had cast longing looks toward the trim steam<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
yacht anchored there, from the stern of which whipped
the Union Jack of England&mdash;he would have given much
for an opportunity to interest Cleo in his daring scheme,
and in Captain Beven he knew he could have had an able
coadjutor, for the sailor liked nothing better than adventure.</p>

<p>Still, Roderic had believed it was best not to seek an
audience with his cousin&mdash;he did not wish to drag her into
the risky game if he could help it.</p>

<p>Perhaps&mdash;who can tell&mdash;some peculiar sense of honor
held him back&mdash;perhaps he reasoned that as this desperate
move on his part, this contemplated rescue of Leon from a
Spanish dungeon and death at sunrise, was but a link in
the chain of his suit for the love of Georgia, it would be
adding insult to injury did he endeavor to enlist Cleo's
services in behalf of the venture.</p>

<p>One thing he had determined to do&mdash;it was really forced
upon him as a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dernier ressort</i>, since there was no other
means of getting Leon out of the country after his escape
from prison had been effected, if he were so fortunate as
to accomplish this.</p>

<p>He had a note written to Cleo in his pocket and this he
meant that Leon and his wife should deliver in person
aboard the yacht.</p>

<p>That Cleo would find means of hiding them on board
until the Dreadnaught sailed for Jamaica he never once
doubted.</p>

<p>With some anxiety he studied the heavens and the conditions
of the weather, for what this August night brought
in its train was a matter of considerable importance to
him.</p>

<p>There would be a moon, very near the full, but clouds
promised to shut it from view, at least the major portion
of the time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>Roderic counted this as an especial favor in his direction.</p>

<p>He meant to take advantage of it.</p>

<p>All minor matters had been positively arranged, even to
the boat in which they were to be carried to the English
yacht, and this was in itself a very important factor in the
game, one that by any neglect in making up the programme
might have proved a fatal error.</p>

<p>He killed time in the early evening by loitering around
the coffee houses and hearing the various opinions expressed
by Spanish soldiers and San Juan citizens regarding
the immediate future of the city, for it was generally
known that Ponce had fallen into the hands of the aggressive
Yankees, and that the "thin blue line" was advancing
across the country in the direction of the north coast, capturing
everything <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en route</i>, even to the hearts of the people,
who hailed the Americans as their deliverers.</p>

<p>It was a distinct pleasure to Roderic to know that the
army of occupation had landed on the soil of Spain's finest
colony, for he realized that the glorious flag of liberty once
planted would never be taken down again.</p>

<p>San Juan did not worry.</p>

<p>Indeed, the city probably never looked more gay than
on this August night, when, after an unusually torrid day
the cool ocean breeze, following the rain, invited every
one to loiter out of doors, and join in the characteristic
Spanish holiday season.</p>

<p>To Roderic these light hearted people were the greatest
of all mysteries.</p>

<p>If New York city were threatened by a hostile army,
and its speedy capture as good as insured, he could imagine
the fearful panic that must take place, how white
faced women, and men too, would throng the streets laden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
with precious household goods, seeking some avenue of
escape.</p>

<p>Yet here was a city that had already experienced some
of the horrors of a bombardment and with another in
prospect, probably of a more drastic nature, giving itself
up to pleasure as wholly as though peace ruled the camp,
the fleet and the grove.</p>

<p>It was astonishing, marvelous!</p>

<p>Roderic of course knew the reason&mdash;he had made a
close study of Spanish character, and found that like the
Southern plantation negro these sons and daughters of
Iberia never worry save over the troubles of the immediate
present.</p>

<p>Let the future take care of itself&mdash;on with the dance&mdash;what
if trouble does come, that will be "<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">manana</i>," to-morrow,
and why should they worry until the time arrives?</p>

<p>Bah! when the first shell from the monitors and battle
ships goes shrieking over the forts to explode perhaps
among the houses of the town&mdash;that will be time enough
to show anxiety, and once started they can make up for
wasted opportunities.</p>

<p>Such is the settled policy of these people, no matter
where found, and it is the main reason why they are outstripped
in the race by such energetic, wide awake, ever
ready to seize an open opportunity nations as the Anglo
Saxons and Teutons.</p>

<p>Spain has accomplished her work on the earth, a savage
and cruel one in many respects, yet fraught with much
daring&mdash;she it was who centuries back sent her bold navigators
to the ends of the little known world to plant the
yellow and crimson banner there&mdash;her barbarous methods
of government led each of her numerous colonies in turn
to revolt and declare the shackles broken from their limbs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
but Spain never changed her policy as did Great Britain
after losing the United States.</p>

<p>With the end of her late war Spain found herself virtually
stripped of colonial possessions, and from this time
forward she must live within herself&mdash;her cruel but in
one sense necessary work in opening the world to light has
been finished and she will never again know the glory that
has been hers in the past.</p>

<p>Roderic often thought over these things, for they were
very pertinent to the subject, and every true blue Yankee
must at times consider the future of these glorious islands
thus coming into possession of the great republic.</p>

<p>Thus he killed time while waiting for the night to move
on.</p>

<p>It was best that he delay his desperate work until San
Juan had at least in a measure quieted down, since there
was more chance of the sentries being careless, and less
fear of running against citizens in the street after the rescue
should have been effected.</p>

<p>The minutes dragged, for he was eager to get to work&mdash;like
a war horse that paws the ground and tugs at his
halter when the distant booming of guns and the pungent
scent of burnt powder announce the battle to have begun.</p>

<p>At length his patience gave out.</p>

<p>By stretching a point the time had come for him to advance
on the outer works, for which he was extremely
grateful; with a sigh of genuine relief he threw off the
incubus that had borne so heavily upon him during this
delay, and set his face toward the ancient fortress that
had seen almost every event of interest happening in San
Juan from the days of that gallant adventurer and seeker
after the Fountain of Youth, Ponce de Leon.</p>

<small>HOW THEY WENT IN.</small></h2>


<p>The battlements and towers of the old fortification
stood up grimly against the clouded heavens when Roderic
drew near&mdash;just as they had reared themselves for
centuries, and looked down upon many of the strangest
scenes marking the history of new America.</p>

<p>Roderic had considerable respect for antiquity, and
yielded the palm to none when it came to holding in reverence
such wonderful mementoes of the past; but common
sense triumphed over such feelings, and when necessity
demanded that he should push the sanctity of age and tradition
into the background, he never hesitated.</p>

<p>Should the success of his avowed undertaking be in
peril he would feel it incumbent upon himself to walk
roughshod over the range and even destroy if necessary
the finest and most venerated relic of olden days.</p>

<p>Such is the price of American progress&mdash;a musty
disease breeding old palace must be transformed into a
modern hive of industry or be leveled to the ground in
order to make way for some edifice of more value to humanity;
for these Americans are a practical people of to-day,
seeking not to perpetuate the evils of the dead past,
but to raise up the masses to a higher plane where they
may enjoy the fruits of their labor, reap the benefits of
free education and worship God in their own way, irrespective
of church and state.</p>

<p>It was well known to Owen that Spanish sentries,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
Mauser in hand, patroled the walls and corridors of the
old building.</p>

<p>He had even marked as minutely as possible where each
soldier's beat began and ended, for it is such little things
as this that count in the long run, often most unexpectedly.</p>

<p>It appeared to be a formidable task for one American
to undertake&mdash;seldom had a heavier load been placed upon
a single pair of shoulders; but fortunately this man was
singularly well equipped for the task, since his previous
work for years had always been in this same line.</p>

<p>He therefore viewed the great ragged pile of ancient
masonry, over which the banner of Castile and Aragon
flapped in the night breeze, with something of the gladiator's
spirit when he was wont to face a tiger in the arena&mdash;the
immensity of the task aroused every atom of determination,
quickened his blood and caused him to feel
an eagerness to open hostilities.</p>

<p>All seemed quiet.</p>

<p>Not far away lay the great barracks of the Spanish soldiers,
and he could even hear them call out at times.</p>

<p>This lent additional piquancy to the game&mdash;when it became
necessary to snatch a condemned prisoner from the
very heart of the Spanish camp, the glory attending success
would be all the greater.</p>

<p>Not that Roderic sought additional sources of danger&mdash;he
would have been satisfied with much less, since his one
purpose was to save Leon and win his sister.</p>

<p>A clock in the city boomed the hour.</p>

<p>"I am on time&mdash;now to see if my fellow laborer has
reached the rendezvous," Roderic muttered.</p>

<p>At one point the shadow of the corner tower fell athwart
the white road and here he turned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>A little birdlike trill greeted his ears&mdash;it might have
proceeded from some feathered songster ensconced among
the leafy vines that covered the rugged wall, and which
had been disturbed by his stealthy advance.</p>

<p>The American seemed to believe otherwise, for he
quickly imitated the sound.</p>

<p>Whereupon there appeared a figure from behind a buttressed
base of the tower wall, a figure that approached
him at first eagerly, then coyly.</p>

<p>Roderic took several steps forward to meet the half unwilling
advance of the other.</p>

<p>"Senora, is it you?" he whispered, eagerly.</p>

<p>"Si, senor," came the low reply from the figure dressed
in masculine garments.</p>

<p>"Good. We are both on time. The night favors us as
much as we could hope for. Let us then go to work without
delay."</p>

<p>"Heaven bless you, senor&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not a word in that line&mdash;it is useless, and dangerous
as well, since sentries are on the ramparts and they have
keen ears. I feared you might not come, for the danger
would appall many."</p>

<p>"Ah! senor, what is danger to me&mdash;what would I not
risk if by so doing I could save <em>his</em> life, my beloved Leon?
Fire and blood could not hold me in check if <em>he</em> called.
My life is his alone, for without him all else would be
dead. That is the love a Spanish woman gives, senor.
Do not forget it when you think of Georgia."</p>

<p>Roderic was thrilled by her words, so intense so full of
devotion&mdash;yes, few nationalities can love with the fire and
enthusiasm shown by Spain's sons and daughters, and if
their affection does not always stand the test of time, lay
it to the burning zeal that eats up the heart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>He remembered that he too was beloved by just such
an impulsive, beautiful girl, who at this hour was doubtless
wrestling with the deep wounds wrought by jealousy's
fingers; and the recollection gave him both <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'ecstacy'">ecstasy</ins>
and keen pain.</p>

<p>At least he said no more to her of the danger she ran&mdash;in
the service of love what matters it where peril lies; the
sacred nature of the duty renders every obligation a privilege.</p>

<p>"Follow me, please, and keep close to the wall. When
I stop do likewise and crouch down. Should one of the
fellows on the walls call out, make no move, utter no
sound, but wait until I direct you."</p>

<p>Such were his brief instructions.</p>

<p>She gave him to understand that she comprehended all
he wished.</p>

<p>Then they moved away, keeping close to the rough
walls, where the shadows lay thickest.</p>

<p>It was a slow and laborious task.</p>

<p>Here and there lay heaps of broken bricks, just where
they had fallen Heaven alone knew how many years back,
since it is a settled Spanish rule never to spoil the picturesque
and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bizarre</i> by miserable modern attempts at
thrift and cleanliness&mdash;vines had grown over the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">debris</i>
and moon flowers whitened the face of the rough wall.</p>

<p>It may have been very pretty, but it made the task Roderic
had marked out more tiresome than it would otherwise
have been.</p>

<p>He did not grumble however, and Inez would never
have complained even though compelled to creep through
an acre of prickly pear or cactus&mdash;her holy fervor of love
sanctified the means, and she blessed the Virgin for allowing
her such a privilege to prove her devotion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>She was a woman in ten thousand&mdash;happy Leon, to
possess such a loyal heart.</p>

<p>Besides, while temporarily suffering from these accumulation
of years, Roderic knew they were soon to
profit through something in the same line.</p>

<p>Leon had escaped from his former prison by means of a
gaping <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'apperture'">aperture</ins> made by an inquisitive Yankee shell&mdash;the
story of his thrilling adventure had made a deep impression
on the mind of Owen, and discovering just such
a grand opening in the wall of the old medieval structure
against which he had now pitted his forces he resolved to
improve upon the experience of Georgia's brother.</p>

<p>They could, if given half a show, both enter and make
their final exit by this means.</p>

<p>He had the location of the opening pretty well in mind,
and was heading for it now.</p>

<p>They had fully embarked upon their perilous mission,
and please Heaven, would sooner or later meet with the
anticipated reward.</p>

<p>The sentinels paced their beats above on the broad
walls, and their "<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">quien vive</i>" as they approached each
other, together with the answer, came plainly to the ears
of those crowded below.</p>

<p>Roderic breathed easier when he discovered that they
had reached the vicinity of this ragged aperture, for at
least one portion of their dangerous journey was over.</p>

<p>He exercised double care at this point, for while the
coast had appeared clear during the day, that was no sign
that it might not be policed after nightfall.</p>

<p>These Spanish sentries have little scruples about opening
fire upon any suspicious person seen in the act of endeavoring
to enter one of their fortifications under the
protecting shades of night&mdash;scores of wretched reconcentradoes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
in Cuba thus paid the penalty of rashness or
curiosity with their lives.</p>

<p>A little close observation told him that in all likelihood
the opening had not been made an especial object of surveillance&mdash;two
slow moving automatons, <em>yclept</em> sentries,
in the process of following their beats to a conclusion approached
this scene of wreck about once in five minutes,
exchanged salutation according to the discipline of the
army, indulged in a little good natured chaff, perhaps
spoke of the chance of soon beholding the beloved hills of
their native land again when the inevitable end came to
the dramatic farce old Spain was playing for the benefit
of those Frenchmen and others holding five hundred
million dollars worth of Cuban bonds&mdash;and then wheeling
left the spot to darkness and the bats for another spell.</p>

<p>It was easy enough to pick out the proper time to begin
the climb, but after once starting they found it a trifle
more difficult to make progress, for the material under
their feet threatened to trip them up, and several times one
of them started some of the broken bricks moving in a
way that opened the possibility of an avalanche.</p>

<p>Thus they had gone but little more than half way when
Roderic, believing the time between the meeting of the
sentries must have elapsed, whispered to his companion
to crouch down and move no more.</p>

<p>At this instant a dislodged brick fell with some little
clatter down the declivity, and the sound appeared magnified
in his ears because of its possible serious results.</p>

<p>A Spanish voice called out above, being answered from
the opposite side, and Roderic looking up could see the
two sentinels plainly outlined, as they stood peering into
the gloom below, and indulging in various speculations as
to the cause of the sound that had reached their ears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a minute of intense suspense, for he had grave
fears lest they bombard the spot with broken bricks, in
order to satisfy their minds that no secret enemy lurked
there.</p>

<p>Fortunately just at this moment a zigzag flying bat,
creature of the tropics, came whirring out of the gloom
below, and actually knocked off one of the sentries' hat,
which unexpected incident caused considerable hard
words from the man who received the scare, and was
greeted with an equal amount of half suppressed laughter
from the other quarter.</p>

<p>At least, since the hat was saved the incident might
be set down as closed&mdash;no bricks were fired into the
chasm, for which Roderic was devoutly thankful, not
merely on his own account, but because he had one under
his charge for whose safety he held himself responsible.</p>

<p>When the two Dromios above had withdrawn and with
shouldered Mausers again sauntered down their several
beats he whispered words of encouragement to the shrinking
form so close at hand, and bade her once more follow
his lead.</p>

<p>The venture proved a success, so far as their <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entree</i> was
concerned, for by the time Spanish eyes and ears again
approached the broken spot in the ramparts the two intruders
had gained the corridor and were safe within the
walls.</p>

<p>This was only a beginning&mdash;the first step.</p>

<p>Around them stretched the massive walls of the ancient
landmark, and somewhere within their confines Leon was
to be found.</p>

<p>Roderic never groped in the dark when there was a
chance for light, and he had used his utmost endeavors
during the day in trying to locate the prisoner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>One portion of the old fortification was literally a picturesque
ruin.</p>

<p>It did not seem possible that even the easy going Spaniards
would confine a prisoner, condemned to be shot, to
this antiquated wreck, for there would be too much chance
of his escaping, especially one who had already proven so
hard to hold as Leon.</p>

<p>This was of course mere speculation on the part of the
Yankee, but he had taken note of several facts that seemed
to corroborate his suspicion.</p>

<p>At any rate so strongly impressed was he with this idea
that once within the fortress he had no hesitation in turning
to the left.</p>

<p>Possibly Roderic never had a more difficult task than
the one now confronting him.</p>

<p>The interior of the great pile of masonry was almost a
sealed book to him, the best he could do during the afternoon
having given him but a shadowy idea as to how it
was constructed.</p>

<p>Of course most of it was inhabited only by bats and
owls, a sombre relic of past glories, which fact added to
the confusion.</p>

<p>Sentries patroled sections of the place, just as had been
marked out for them&mdash;indeed, it was almost impossible
to know when one of these jack-in-the-box guardians
might bob up serenely directly in the intruder's path.</p>

<p>This fact kept Roderic's nerves on a tension; but the
sensation was no new one to him&mdash;he felt pretty much as
does the hound held in leash, and scenting the game near
by.</p>

<p>Inez followed him closely.</p>

<p>She was "dead game" as Roderic more than once muttered
to himself when he noticed how she copied his movements.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>Never did man have a more faithful and devoted spouse,
ready to undertake all risks for his sake&mdash;never did
woman have a motive more sacred to urge her forward
to the rescue of one beloved.</p>

<p>Roderic knew he was enlisted in a good cause, and in
his mind this counted for much.</p>

<p>Their progress while laborious, seemed to be in the
right direction.</p>

<p>Evidences multiplied to the effect that this wing of the
fortress was under surveillance, as though it contained
that over which it was necessary a guard should be
placed.</p>

<p>Roderic had been in Russia&mdash;he had visited the historic
pile of masonry at St. Petersburg on the Volga known as
the Fortress of Peter and Paul, and had seen its numerous
dungeons, its impregnable gates and the wonderful
methods in vogue among the troops guarding its walls.</p>

<p>Something about this structure in San Juan recalled the
prison and fort of Holy Russia&mdash;perhaps it was the
gloom, the dark dungeons and general funereal aspect of
the place, for surely there could be little comparison otherwise.</p>

<p>Occasionally the moon appeared and gave them some
means of seeing what lay ahead; but on these occasions
they were compelled to lie quiet so that their presence
might not be discovered.</p>

<p>All the while they were progressing.</p>

<p>A labyrinth of masonry surrounded them, and Roderic
had to bring to bear many shrewd tactics in order to keep
from getting lost.</p>

<p>His usual manner of doing this was simple and yet wonderfully
effective.</p>

<p>When they came to a place where the passage forked,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
and it appeared puzzling to judge which way they should
turn, he did not decide hastily but spent a little time in
ascertaining whether one of the routes did not show more
signs of usage than the other, and in every case he found
a very distinct difference.</p>

<p>By following the passage in general use it stood to reason
that he would sooner or later reach the closed <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'dun-'">dungeon</ins>.</p>

<p>Through such tactics, employed with success by those
Nimrods of the forests in their search after game, Roderic
had always been able to accomplish tasks that were
deemed next to impossible by others of his craft, who
governed their actions by antiquated rules lacking in common
sense.</p>

<p>It was evident that they had crossed the Rubicon&mdash;that
their bridges had been burned behind them.</p>

<p>Once discovered in the depths of this place and the
chances seemed twenty to one that they would never leave
it alive.</p>

<p>Roderic scouted such a thought&mdash;he never allowed it to
interfere with his work&mdash;chances of failure were not to
be taken as a factor in the matter whatever&mdash;success must
be the beacon held up to lure them on, glorious success.</p>

<p>Such confidence brings wonderful results in all things,
and would account for some of the success attending his
past.</p>

<p>A brilliant diplomat is compelled to be bold as well as
sagacious.</p>

<p>To find Leon and bring about his release&mdash;to cheat the
Spanish army of a victim whom they expected to execute
at sunrise&mdash;this was the mission he had undertaken, and
with the kind assistance of good fortune, added to his tact,
he meant that the harvest should be bountiful.</p>

<small>THE STRANGE MEETING IN THE DUNGEON.</small></h2>


<p>A gentle tug at his coat made Roderic turn.</p>

<p>It was Inez, who desired to speak, and yet who knew
she should not utter a word above the lowest whisper.</p>

<p>"What is it?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Tell me&mdash;are we not nearing there&mdash;I am so anxious&mdash;my
heart almost suffocates me, for it beats like wildfire,"
she gasped.</p>

<p>He pitied her, for he could easily understand why she
should thus feel distressed.</p>

<p>"Courage&mdash;we cannot be far away from his cell now.
Bear up, and all will be well. To fail at this time would
mean his death."</p>

<p>Roderic did not add that their own fate would probably
be also sealed&mdash;he knew that fact only too well, but
it was useless to mention it.</p>

<p>At any rate all Inez thought of was Leon's welfare.</p>

<p>She seemed to call upon some reserve force, and her
companion knew the crisis had been safely passed, for
which he was deeply thankful.</p>

<p>When he said he believed they were near the spot where
they would find Leon, he spoke truly.</p>

<p>There were strong evidences of dungeons all around
them, some with the doors entirely gone, while others had
a stout barrier hanging from one great rusty hinge.</p>

<p>It might be supposed that ere long they would run
across those still remaining in a good state of preservation,
and in which prisoners were confined.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>Perhaps an especial guard had been stationed in the
passage.</p>

<p>If so it would be Roderic's duty to take care of him,
and to this end he had previously made ample preparation.</p>

<p>Desperate measures are only carried to a successful
issue by heroic treatment, and no man was better equipped
for this purpose than the American who dared enter San
Juan while the Spanish flag still waved over the walls.</p>

<p>The darkness was now against them, and it would have
been almost impossible to advance but for a streak of luck
that separated clouds and moon, and allowed the latter
to sift her silvery radiance down through various breaches
in the overhanging walls, thus dissipating to some extent
the appalling gloom.</p>

<p>Thanks then to this feeble illumination Roderic with his
keen vision was enabled to discover a figure ahead.</p>

<p>Spanish soldiers doing duty in the tropics are generally
in the habit of wearing white uniforms made of some
coarse drilling or canvas.</p>

<p>It was this fact that betrayed the presence of the guard,
and Roderic mentally thanked his lucky stars for the
favor.</p>

<p>He watched the man.</p>

<p>The Spaniard seemed nervous, and would walk up and
down with jerky steps, stopping now and then to try the
doors of several cells.</p>

<p>Roderic was unable to decide what the man was up to,
since Spanish soldiers as a rule are not given to exert
themselves overly much.</p>

<p>Now and then the fellow would stop, and at such times
his attitude strongly reminded the watcher of one who was
straining his hearing in the hope of catching some eagerly
anticipated signal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>After a little reflection Roderic felt compelled to decide
that the fellow was anxiously waiting for a relief guard
to appear, although this hardly satisfied him.</p>

<p>His duty in the premises was clear enough.</p>

<p>That guard was in the way.</p>

<p>He threatened to block their game just when, after
surmounting so many difficulties, it promised to bring
them success.</p>

<p>Such a thing could not be allowed.</p>

<p>The guard would have to succumb, like all Spaniards,
to superior Yankee dominion.</p>

<p>First he must give Inez warning as to his intentions, so
that she might not be alarmed when he quitted her side.</p>

<p>He found her very sensible, for she realized that some
such move must be adopted to get rid of the miserable
sentry.</p>

<p>"Spare him not, senor&mdash;he has doubtless taken delight
in torturing my Leon&mdash;have no pity on the wretch," she
whispered in his ear, with considerable warmth.</p>

<p>Roderic had his own notion about the eternal fitness of
things, and being a cool, sensible American instead of a
hot blooded Spaniard, he was decidedly averse to shedding
blood when such a thing might possibly be avoided.</p>

<p>There were other ways of accomplishing the same end,
this Yankee brain decided.</p>

<p>With a few last words of caution to Inez, who was
trembling all over with excitement, he left her and started
upon his advance.</p>

<p>An old Indian fighter might have been proud of the progress
Roderic made.</p>

<p>He imitated a cat creeping upon a bird, his eyes being
glued upon the white garbed figure of the guard, and
every movement governed by that of the man who carried
the Mauser.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<p>Foot by foot he went forward.</p>

<p>The guard was muttering to himself as he still moved
restlessly from one heavy door to another.</p>

<p>Something undoubtedly disturbed him, but it was a
mystery to Roderic, who could not quite catch the words
he let fall, and which might have simplified matters had
he heard them.</p>

<p>The closer he drew the more cautious he became.</p>

<p>Everything depended on the successful issue of his
plans; even his own future happiness was at stake in the
matter.</p>

<p>It may be taken for granted, therefore, that he exercised
his utmost care, for after all there is no motive so positive
of good results in a general way, as self interest&mdash;it makes
a success of co-operative factories wherever tried.</p>

<p>Roderic was finally in a position to lay his plans for a
finish.</p>

<p>He waited until the man's back was turned and then
slipped forward to a certain dark doorway previously selected.</p>

<p>Then he awaited the return of the sentry&mdash;awaited him
as the tiger lies in cover for his advancing prey, with
muscles tense and drawn, and every small nerve on the
alert for the desperate charge.</p>

<p>Ah! the fellow in pursuing his eccentric tactics had
reached what appeared to be the terminus of his beat, and
wheeling had started back, utterly unconscious of what
lay in store for him and that each nervous step took him
closer to his fate.</p>

<p>Roderic was perfectly cool and collected&mdash;he was not in
the habit of giving way to excitement and losing his advantage.</p>

<p>As he thus lay in wait and watched the advance of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
dusky figure which he had set out to overcome, he even
selected the very portion of the sentry's person upon
which he should throw his full force.</p>

<p>Closer still.</p>

<p>The man's fate hung like the sword of Damocles, as by
a single hair.</p>

<p>Roderic timed his leap with such precision that he
struck the sentry totally unawares.</p>

<p>A dark figure launched forward like a gigantic bat&mdash;the
man only had time to give a gurgle of surprise when a
firm hand closed on his throat, and the sound died there.</p>

<p>Such was the impetus of Roderic's advance that the two
of them went to the stone floor.</p>

<p>Immediately the American felt his antagonist cease to
struggle, and he knew the other must have been knocked
senseless through the blow on the head received when he
came in contact with the flagging.</p>

<p>The percussion had sounded loud enough at least, to
account for his having lost all interest in affairs mundane.</p>

<p>Roderic hoped he was not killed, nor did he have any
reason to believe such a fate had overtaken the wretched
guard.</p>

<p>At least everything seemed to be working beautifully
in his favor, and he certainly could find no cause for complaint.</p>

<p>What was to be done with this pretty thing, now that
he had secured the prize?</p>

<p>The man might prove to be something of a white elephant
on his hands.</p>

<p>However, his first move was to drag out some stout
cord, with which he made the fellow's hands and feet secure.</p>

<p>In doing so he could not but notice,&mdash;through touch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
more than sight, since the darkness was only partially dissipated
by the moon's inquisitive beams that forced an
entrance&mdash;that the luckless guard had delicate hands such
as he had seldom noticed among the common Spanish soldiers.</p>

<p>At another time he might have endeavored to assign
some logical reason for this thing, but just at the present
crisis it mattered little.</p>

<p>The end and not the means engrossed his fullest attention.</p>

<p>When he took hold of the senseless guard and began
dragging him across the corridor to the shade that lay
more densely in that quarter, it was only with the intention
of getting him out of the way, so that in case any one
came along he would not stumble over the fellow and thus
have the peculiar status of affairs rudely thrust upon his
attention.</p>

<p>Perhaps Roderic was not as careful as he might and
should have been&mdash;at any rate he tripped and fell over
some object lying in his way.</p>

<p>Even as he went down he was strongly impressed with
the suspicion that what he had taken his cropper over was
a human being, and possibly a second guard enjoying a
quiet nap.</p>

<p>Hence, Roderic scrambled up in all haste with the intention
of throwing himself upon the fellow, and if possible
preventing him from giving the alarm, for that was
what his wretched mistake might end in.</p>

<p>To his surprise as well as gratification there was not
the least sign of an aroused sentry endeavoring to gather
his scattered senses and shout for help.</p>

<p>All was silent.</p>

<p>He put out his hand, groping for the object which had
been the cause of his tumble.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<p>When finally he touched it a peculiar sensation flashed
over him from head to foot, for in truth it was a human
being.</p>

<p>Could the man be dead?</p>

<p>Had there been some drunken dispute between the
guards resulting in a tragedy?</p>

<p>He remembered the peculiar actions of the man who
now lay bound near by.</p>

<p>Bending over the second fellow he speedily made a discovery
of some moment.</p>

<p>A strong scent of liquor greeted him and his hand came
upon the flask still clutched in the miserable guard's hand.</p>

<p>Where he got it, and why the second man did not take
his share were puzzling questions which Roderic only
shook his head over.</p>

<p>For him it was quite sufficient that the two sentries
had in different ways been rendered <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">hors de combat</i>, and
would so far as he could see, give him no further trouble.</p>

<p>So he left them there, the second chap with his head
resting lovingly upon the body of the toper, two of a kind
and well matched, he considered.</p>

<p>Perhaps there would be a reckoning when the officer of
the guard came around later, though if the flask still contained
a portion of its original contents he might forgive
the erring one.</p>

<p>Roderic sincerely hoped he had seen the last of the two
guards&mdash;he expressed a low but earnest desire that their
slumbers might be sweet, and indefinitely prolonged&mdash;at
least until his desperate work had been accomplished.</p>

<p>He uttered a low signal, the same bird call that, trilling
forth at the tower corner of the fortress had brought Inez
to his side.</p>

<p>She heard and gladly tripped forward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a supreme moment for her&mdash;the girl was tremendously
excited, and cast several quick glances toward
the spot where the demoralized section of the invincible
Spanish army lay.</p>

<p>Roderic noticed how her eager hand crept toward her
bosom as she looked toward the dimly seen figures, and
he quickly said:</p>

<p>"Come, we must find the door of his cell."</p>

<p>"You leave foes upon the trail you must tread on your
return," was the significant way in which she put it.</p>

<p>"They are helpless&mdash;God forbid I should do murder,"
he returned, knowing at the same time that the Spanish
way was the safer way.</p>

<p>The first cell door was beside them.</p>

<p>Roderic, bending over discovered that it was secured
by a heavy iron bar&mdash;so far as he could see there was no
other obstacle to an entrance.</p>

<p>He seized upon this and exerting his strength threw it
over.</p>

<p>It made something of a clanking sound, possibly subdued,
but to Roderic's mind very like the gong of a railway
station dining room.</p>

<p>Inez uttered a low cry of alarm and he could hear her
whisper the name of her patron saint, as if invoking heavenly
aid.</p>

<p>"It's all right&mdash;don't be alarmed," he said, encouragingly.</p>

<p>Roderic waited to draw out a little pocket lantern which
when lighted would throw some illumination upon their
path.</p>

<p>This done he tried the door, and finding it fast put his
shoulder to it.</p>

<p>Under such pressure further resistance was utterly out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
of the question, and the heavy barrier quickly gave way.</p>

<p>Inez would have rushed headlong in but Roderic's
sturdy arm prevented&mdash;he believed it was his duty to
still lead the van so long as the future was unknown&mdash;it
would be time enough to yield that place of vantage to his
frail companion in the venture when success had been assured.</p>

<p>So they passed into the gloomy dungeon, the history of
which would doubtless prove interesting reading as shedding
a strong light upon Spain's methods of colonizing,
for in the years gone no doubt many a political prisoner
had been tortured here with all the despotic barbarism that
marked the infernal Inquisition of old.</p>

<p>Looking eagerly around the cell Roderic almost immediately
discovered the object of his search.</p>

<p>Some one was standing beside a chair at the further end&mdash;some
one who had evidently risen hastily at the sound
of the clanking iron bar&mdash;some one who uttered a cry at
their rough entrance.</p>

<p>Roderic saw and was at once struck with the astonishing
likeness to Georgia in the smooth faced young man
standing there; but he had been prepared for that fact
since she herself had impressed it on his mind when he
demanded how he might know Leon should he meet him.</p>

<p>Yes, brother and sister were very much alike and the
sight of him just then gave Roderic something of a shock,
since it seemed as though he were gazing upon Georgia.</p>

<p>There was no longer any need of restraining Inez&mdash;at
sight of the prisoner she had uttered a cry bubbling over
with limitless delight and unable to longer keep back the
eager desire to reach him, to convince her ravished eyes
that they did not deceive her soul, she sped forward.</p>

<p>Not straighter does the arrow fly from the warrior's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
bow than this devoted Spanish girl went to the object of
her devotion.</p>

<p>Surely eyes of love could easily recognize in the seeming
youth the beautiful daughter of Morro's governor.</p>

<p>Her hat had fallen off in the struggle with Roderic, and
her luxuriant hair dropped almost to her waist, rendering
further deception utterly out of the question.</p>

<p>Roderic fully expected to see the amazed prisoner open
his arms and eagerly take her close to his heart in a transport
of joy.</p>

<p>It was only natural that he should look for just such
an ending to the devoted wife's adventurous search.</p>

<p>To the astonishment of the American nothing of the
kind occurred&mdash;indeed, a result about as contrary as one
could well conceive, came to pass.</p>

<p>As Inez was about to throw her arms about the figure
of the handsome young fellow, he put out his hand and
gave her a vigorous push aside, a push that caused the
poor girl to stagger back against the wall.</p>

<p>And with his great black eyes flashing with indignation
the prisoner cried out:</p>

<p>"Do not dare to touch me&mdash;go back to yonder double
faced traitor, and leave me to my fate. I would sooner
be left here to moulder than be <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'resuced'">rescued</ins> by you, <em>creature!</em>"</p>

<p>Roderic was panic stricken&mdash;he could scarcely believe
the evidence of his senses&mdash;the prisoner of the dungeon
was to all appearances Leon, yet the voice was that of
Georgia&mdash;the words evidently spoken by one racked with
jealousy, who saw in Inez a hated rival!</p>

<small>WHEN THE OFFICER OF THE GUARD CAME.</small></h2>


<p>It was a remarkable tableau.</p>

<p>The dark dungeon with its mouldy stone walls was
a fitting background.</p>

<p>Roderic's little lantern did not cast a superabundance
of light, but there was enough to show the three figures
in the scene.</p>

<p>Inez, poor girl, had staggered back and seemed almost
paralyzed&mdash;half crouching she leaned one hand against
the wall for support, and with eyes distended by amazement
and horror, stared at the prisoner as though appalled
by the thought that her Leon had gone mad&mdash;that
the cruel Spaniards had driven him out of his mind, else
why should he treat her so roughly, she who would give
her life for him if need be?</p>

<p>Roderic grasped the truth, and yet it was so astounding
that he could not believe the positive evidence of his
senses.</p>

<p>It seemed as though the hand of a magician had been
extended to bring about such an amazing transformation.</p>

<p>He came to rescue Leon, and found in the young man's
dungeon&mdash;Georgia!</p>

<p>Was ever surprise more complete?</p>

<p>Who could the wizard be&mdash;had brother and sister the
power of changing their personality at will?</p>

<p>Strange fancies rioted through his excited mind as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
he stood there and stared&mdash;the situation was remarkable
enough to arouse the most extravagant and marvelous
thoughts.</p>

<p>At the same time Roderic was conscious of a powerful
desire to take this bold maid of San Juan to his heart,
for his love was still strong within him.</p>

<p>And as he thus stood and looked at her, perhaps with
reproach upon his face, the anger seemed to gradually
die away from her eyes, the color returned to her cheeks,
her upraised hand that had flung Inez so violently back
fell to her side and she trembled with a mixture of emotions.</p>

<p>Strange place indeed for an explanation and yet Roderic
knew it was bound to come.</p>

<p>He wished to know many things, and on her part a
revolution of feeling must take part in her heart toward
the devoted being whom she had so scornfully thrust
aside.</p>

<p>Of the three then, Inez was the first to find her tongue,
to give utterance to the anguish that racked her soul.</p>

<p>"Holy Mother," she wailed, "he knows me not&mdash;they
have robbed him of reason&mdash;they have broken my heart.
Oh! Leon, unsay those cruel words&mdash;tell me that you
still love me, or I too must go mad!"</p>

<p>The prisoner of the fortress doubtless heard, but never
once were those luminous midnight orbs removed from
Roderic's face.</p>

<p>His disguise might have baffled some but it was of no
avail where those eyes were concerned.</p>

<p>One look and the mask had been torn away&mdash;she had
known him from the instant he rushed through the arched
doorway.</p>

<p>By this time Roderic had succeeded in mastering his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
emotions&mdash;at least he was in a fair way to gradually assume
control.</p>

<p>The situation, too, was becoming unbearable, for
Georgia, if the prisoner could be the girl he loved, seemed
gradually being overwhelmed by confusion, perhaps because
thus seen in male attire by the man whose respect
she desired above all others, or it might be from some
other equally potent reason.</p>

<p>"Georgia!"</p>

<p>Just one word, but what an effect it had upon the other&mdash;the
prisoner of the dungeon burst into tears, all the
while protesting and accusing Roderic of duplicity, declaring
that her love had turned to hate, and yet giving
this assertion the lie by the very emphasis with which
she spoke.</p>

<p>It was a tirade of almost meaningless phrases, just such
as one might expect from an impulsive whole hearted
daughter of the tropics, who loved and suffered, and
whose brave front, artificially sustained, had given way
under this sudden shock.</p>

<p>Roderic did not wince&mdash;Roderic knew he held the
magic power in his grasp whereby he could change this
mourning into rejoicing&mdash;he knew she loved him in spite
of what she might say, yes loved him with an undying
affection such as only a woman of her stamp could experience.</p>

<p>He waited a minute or so until she had exhausted the
violence of her emotions.</p>

<p>When finally she had hidden her face in her hands,
as if she dared no longer let him gaze upon her weakness,
Roderic took a step toward her and spoke gently.</p>

<p>At the sound of his beloved voice she trembled like an
aspen leaf, and as she heard the astounding intelligence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
imparted by his calm words, first she looked from between
her fingers, then both hands fell from her face, and finally
with bated breath she hung upon his closing sentences,
utterly transformed, radiant with a sudden return of
happiness such as she had believed could never again be
her portion on earth.</p>

<p>What he said was but a hurried review of this meeting
with Inez under such strange conditions, the appointment
he had made for a rendezvous in the plaza, and last
of all their desperate undertaking in company on this
night, resolved to save Leon if it be in mortal power to
do so.</p>

<p>She looked toward Inez, into whose brain something of
the wonderful truth was beginning to enter.</p>

<p>That look no longer spoke of contempt and hatred&mdash;there
was a new light in her eye as though her soul had
awakened to a glorious realization of the possibilities
opening before.</p>

<p>In Inez the devoted daughter of Morro's stern governor,
the girl who had saved Leon from a prison cell in
Cuba, the woman whose love had made her that same
Leon's wife and who was therefore her own sister, she
saw a different being from the dark-eyed houri whom
she once believed had stolen Roderic's heart&mdash;circumstances
alter cases, and the same scene we have looked
upon in the deceptive moonlight becomes transformed in
the garish light of day.</p>

<p>"His wife&mdash;my brother's wife&mdash;oh! what is this strange
thing you tell me&mdash;that would be too much happiness&mdash;I
must be dreaming."</p>

<p>The girl had met with such a revulsion of feeling that
she threatened to become incoherent again; but Roderic,
advancing another step laid a hand upon her arm, his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
touch acting like magic, for he seemed to infuse some of
his own calmness into her.</p>

<p>"Go closer to Inez&mdash;see, the poor girl is bewildered,
overwhelmed at finding you here when she expected Leon,
just as I too am deeply puzzled. Speak to her&mdash;ask her
who she is, and what she seeks at the risk of her life.
Ah! you cannot hate her, sweetheart, she who loves your
brother so dearly&mdash;your sister. Take her to your heart,
you two whom Heaven has brought together so strangely."</p>

<p>His words stirred both of those who heard&mdash;the girls
looked at each other yearningly, for a new emotion had
leaped into their souls.</p>

<p>Unable to longer restrain their feminine feelings they
were speedily clasped in each other's arms, while Roderic
stood by, holding his little lantern, complacently
watching the demonstration, meanwhile congratulating
himself that his skies had cleared and that the future
promised glorious possibilities.</p>

<p>He was still greatly puzzled and for the life of him
unable to comprehend how Georgia could take the place of
Leon in this dungeon of the old fortress, difficult of access
and vigilantly guarded by not only one but two sentries.</p>

<p>At the same time he knew an explanation would speedily
be forthcoming, and hence exercised what patience
he possessed.</p>

<p>It is not so difficult to do this when all things seem to
be coming one's way.</p>

<p>Presently Georgia remembered.</p>

<p>As she turned from Inez and faced her lover, face and
neck were suffused with scarlet.</p>

<p>In his eyes it was a beautiful sight, and he could not
remember ever having seen her look so charming.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh! Roderic, can you, will you forgive my cruel, unjust
suspicions, my insane jealousy that caused me to
treat you so bitterly, that refused to hear your explanations?
I do not deserve your love, but God knows I
could not live without it. Tell me you forgive such a
wretch, and make me happy again."</p>

<p>He opened wide his arms, and forgetting her confusion,
forgetting everything but that she loved him and had
again found Paradise, her head was quickly pillowed on
his shoulder, and she looked up into his face, smiling
through her tears.</p>

<p>"You do forgive?"</p>

<p>"As I hope to be forgiven. Let it be forgotten, even
as you said of my transgression. We love&mdash;we have been
true to each other&mdash;the future lies before us, why should
we burden ourselves with foolish doubts and fears?
From this hour then we begin anew, nor may all Satan's
power prevail against us, nor shall I have reason to fear
a Jerome or a Julio, the latter of whom turns out to be
the erring black sheep in the family of Inez&mdash;her step-brother.
As to Leon&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Carramba!</i> yes, what of Leon?" cried Inez, with suddenly
renewed interest.</p>

<p>What indeed.</p>

<p>Roderic himself was conscious of a keen interest in
the young man&mdash;where had he gone and what brought
Georgia to his dungeon?</p>

<p>Plainly the time had arrived for explanations, nor did
Georgia show a disposition to withhold them.</p>

<p>"You wonder to find me here?" she said, releasing herself
from his arms.</p>

<p>"Naturally so."</p>

<p>"And disguised as&mdash;as, a man," with confusion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>"Under the conditions if you came here at all it would
have to be under false colors."</p>

<p>"The case was desperate&mdash;it admitted of no false modesty.
Leon was to be shot in the morning. I laid my
plans and sought help of the only one I believed I could
trust in all San Juan. Heaven bless her kind spirit, and
forgive me for ever having believed she could have
stooped so low as to take the heart that belonged to me."</p>

<p>"What! you went to Cleo?" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Nothing more nor less, since I dared not ask the active
assistance of my guardian Don Porfidio, who endeavored
in vain to have Leon's sentence dismissed or
changed. Yes, the Senorita Cleo not only received me
warmly but gave me aid and promised that if we succeeded
Leon should sail away on her yacht to safety."</p>

<p>"God bless her!" muttered Roderic.</p>

<p>"And he will, beloved, depend on it. But time will
not permit me to tell all. Her Captain Beven came
ashore with me, and waits near by for us to join him.
Unfortunately we met Jerome on the street, showing
Captain Shackelford the sights of San Juan. I know
he recognized me in spite of my disguise for they hung
upon our track until we drew near the fortress. I fear
he may discover the truth and in some way overwhelm
us with trouble. He is my evil genius&mdash;something
within tells me that through Senor Wellington the most
bitter trial of my life must come. But at last we seemed
to shake them off, and I found an opportunity to enter
this awful place."</p>

<p>Roderic shuddered to think of this valiant girl undertaking
such a gigantic task alone&mdash;it seemed almost incredible,
and he would not have believed it had not the
fact come under his own observation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>

<p>"But&mdash;how did you gain entrance to this cell, and&mdash;where
has Leon gone?"</p>

<p>"Yes, tell us of him, I implore," echoed Inez, who had
hung upon every word.</p>

<p>"You shall hear. I already knew where my poor
brother was confined,&mdash;how I learned the facts I shall not
say just now; and after infinite trouble I came to where
a guard walked up and down before a barred door behind
which I was positive Leon might be found.</p>

<p>"All had been prepared, Captain Beven having so
doctored a flask of liquor that the wretch drinking half
of it would be overwhelmed by sleep.</p>

<p>"While the guard walked away from me I placed this
bait where he would be apt to kick it with his foot on
his return.</p>

<p>"Everything worked smoothly, Senor Owen&mdash;the fellow
gulped down some of the stuff and presently slept
as sweetly as a cherub."</p>

<p>"Is sleeping still, and good for ten hours," declared
Roderic, and then resumed his attitude of listener, believing
that something of deep importance was coming
next.</p>

<p>"When this result had been secured I opened the door
and found Leon alive and well."</p>

<p>Inez uttered a fervent prayer of thanks.</p>

<p>"I had brought him some garments to put on, such as
the Spanish soldiers wear, but knowing the hour was near
when the officer of the guard would come along to see
that each sentry was in his place it was decided that until
that critical time passed I was to remain in the cell, while
with the door barred Leon would take the sentry's gun
and mount guard&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Inez uttered a startled cry that seemed to come from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
her very soul, and turning from them darted toward the
door of the dungeon.</p>

<p>Roderic knew what it meant.</p>

<p>He suddenly remembered how he had placed the nervous
guard <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">hors de combat</i>&mdash;at the time he considered
this a remarkably clever piece of business&mdash;now he was
ready to call himself a fool for his action.</p>

<p>Good Heavens! what if he had gone a little further
than he intended&mdash;what if the breath had refused to return
to the seeming guard after his fall&mdash;it was Leon
whom he had assailed, Leon, the very man for whose
sake, considering the fact that he was <em>her</em> brother, he had
taken all this deadly risk.</p>

<p>No wonder then he hurried after the impulsive wife,
whom love sent flying through the cell door.</p>

<p>And Georgia, as yet failing to grasp the true sense of
the situation, and unwilling to remain behind, also followed.</p>

<p>As Roderic issued from the dungeon he discovered
Inez bending over the form of the bound guard, and the
American held his breath with suspense as he hurried
toward them.</p>

<p>Ere he arrived however he was reassured.</p>

<p>"He lives, senor, thanks be to the Virgin&mdash;it is I, my
Leon, your Inez who has sworn to save you nor share
your fate. A knife Senor Owen, so that we may cut
loose his arms. Oh! blessed moment that I behold you
alive!"</p>

<p>Thus alternately addressing Roderic and anon her husband,
Inez pillowed the head of the bound man, who
seemed too amazed to speak.</p>

<p>When however Roderic had opened his pocket knife
and severed the bonds with which he had so carefully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
bound his victim, he was rejoiced to see him immediately
sit up.</p>

<p>All seemed to be going well.</p>

<p>Perhaps fortune had other favors in store for them&mdash;at
least the clouds were rolling away, leaving a clear
sky above.</p>

<p>Inez had by this time managed to get her arms around
the neck of her husband, and was uttering happy expressions
of endearment.</p>

<p>Roderic himself would not have minded copying this
example, with the being he loved so close by, but just
at this juncture the happy scene was rudely and suddenly
disturbed by a gruff voice uttering in vigorous Spanish
some astonishment at what was occurring in the grim passage
of the old fortress.</p>

<p>Of course it was the miserable officer making his
rounds, and who had arrived just at this interesting moment.</p>

<small>A RACE TO THE BOAT.</small></h2>


<p>It was dreadfully unfortunate that such a miserable
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">contretemps</i> seemed bound to occur as that the officer
of the guard must arrive upon the scene just at this moment.</p>

<p>Roderic, upon hearing the first Spanish word in that
thick voice knew discovery was at hand, and the little
cherub of good fortune had suddenly taken a back seat.</p>

<p>If anything were done to prevent a general alarm
from going forth, it would have to come from him, since
Leon was hardly in a position to attempt any aggressive
act, having a woman's arms about his neck.</p>

<p>Roderic unfortunately had his back turned in the
quarter from whence the men advanced, else he might
have detected the glow of light even before they turned
the corner of the passage.</p>

<p>There was little use in crying over spilt milk.</p>

<p>What was done could not be undone.</p>

<p>The best he could do was to make some show of holding
the enemy, perhaps incarcerating him in the dungeon
so lately Leon's abode.</p>

<p>Unfortunately it happened that the rules and regulations
of the Spanish army do not allow a captain of the
guard to make his rounds alone and unattended.</p>

<p>A non commissioned officer, perhaps a sergeant, stood
at his side holding the lantern and presenting a most astonished
appearance at witnessing so remarkable a scene.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<p>Roderic, without losing time, made a dive at the two
soldiers, having whipped out his revolver.</p>

<p>"Surrender!" he exclaimed, not forgetting to put the
emphatic word in Spanish as became the character he
represented.</p>

<p>To his disgust the fellow who held the lantern was so
overwhelmed by his alarm that his fingers lost their grip,
consequently the article of illumination fell from his grasp
and as Roderic's little affair had taken a notion to go out,
owing to the abrupt movement he made, they found themselves
enveloped in darkness that was not excelled by
that of Egypt when the plague came.</p>

<p>It was very very unfortunate.</p>

<p>Just when the Yankee had begun to feel confident he
could grasp the game, and manipulate it to his liking, it
was snatched out of his hands.</p>

<p>He knew the two men were beating a hasty retreat,
for they made plenty of noise as they stumbled along the
dark passage.</p>

<p>"We must lose no time&mdash;Leon, look to your wife&mdash;this
way Georgia&mdash;please Heaven we will yet find safety
on Cleo's yacht."</p>

<p>He had thrown a stout arm around her, and together
they pushed forward, while the others came close behind.</p>

<p>At last the moon had pity for their misfortunes, for
presently the fair mistress of the night shone forth and
dissipated some of the shadows that had hung so heavily
around them.</p>

<p>If it had been of moment that Roderic should use caution
in making his advance toward the dungeon, surely
there was now double reason for such exactness, since
their case was desperate enough without any further accidents,
such as wandering from the beaten track.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>Fortunately they were two, and where his knowledge of
the right passage was in doubt Georgia came to the rescue
with her woman's wit.</p>

<p>Thus they went on without a mistake.</p>

<p>It was useless to hope they could escape from the whole
result of this unfortunate discovery, for the captain of
the guard and his attendant had kept up a constant bawling
as they stumbled and threshed along, so if under
the impression that an enemy chased hard upon their heels
with naked swords, ready to impale them thereon.</p>

<p>Of course this must ere now have placed every guard
along the ramparts on the alert, and the chances of the
fugitives getting out of the fortress in safety were scant
indeed.</p>

<p>"Faint heart ne'er won fair lady," as Roderic well
knew, and he was one of those men who, having sallied
forth to accomplish a given object, allow no obstacle to
prevent them from attaining that end, so long as a sturdy
arm can prevail.</p>

<p>He never magnified evils that cast their ugly shadows
before, while at the same time it was not his principle
to under estimate a foe.</p>

<p>At length they drew near the breach in the wall, which
had offered Roderic such friendly assistance when entering
the fortress of San Juan.</p>

<p>He had not forgotten the two sentries to whose interesting
remarks he had listened as he crouched there in
the dark aperture under their feet.</p>

<p>He could see them plainly standing there in an expectant
attitude, as though under the belief that an attack
of some sort was coming, for in no other way could
they account for the loud shouts borne to their ears.</p>

<p>It was a case necessitating heroic treatment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p>Roderic knew that nothing could be gained by delay
and that the demoralization of the guards was what
would be to their best advantage.</p>

<p>He crawled in advance of the others and deliberately
opened fire upon the two men.</p>

<p>It was his intention to wound rather than slay, but
he had life and liberty at stake, and could not be blamed
if he sent in the shots thick and fast. The way must be
cleared and those fellows above held it in their power
to prevent an escape, since they controlled the only exit
with which he was acquainted.</p>

<p>Nor was the bombardment all one sided.</p>

<p>The first sentry was struck in the leg, and dropping
his Mauser rifle he went hobbling away, bellowing as
lustily as a calf; but his comrade was made of better
stuff, and at once opened fire in the quarter from whence
the shots came.</p>

<p>This was serious enough, for one of the steel clad bullets,
even while missing Roderic might glance from
some stone and do damage beyond.</p>

<p>So the American forgot that he had intended to simply
wound, and began firing point blank, in the hope of downing
the Spaniard before he could do any damage.</p>

<p>He was rejoiced then to see the man suddenly stagger
back, raise his weapon half way to his shoulder, fire a
last shot; and then gun and sentry fell on the rampart
together.</p>

<p>The way was open!</p>

<p>It had been cleared at heavy cost&mdash;just how heavy Roderic
did not even suspect at the time.</p>

<p>"Come," he said, huskily, "over the wall and down to
safety&mdash;it is our only hope!"</p>

<p>And while the roll of the drum called the Spanish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
garrison to quarters and soldiers hurried to doubly guard
the walls, the fugitives scrambled over the debris that
half blocked the breach in the old fortress made by the
guns of Sampson's war ships.</p>

<p>Over these impediments Roderic assisted Georgia, nor
could he fail to notice how strangely she seemed to hesitate,
trusting almost entirely in his strong arm, which
was so unlike the Georgia he had known of old.</p>

<p>Perhaps the realization of her dream, and the rescue
of Leon from his dungeon had brought about this singular
result.</p>

<p>At any rate there was no time given in which to consider
it.</p>

<p>Prompt action alone could take them through with
flying colors.</p>

<p>The martial sounds increased&mdash;one could almost imagine
the garrison prepared to receive an attack from the
whole of General Miles' invading army.</p>

<p>If noise could accomplish it such an assault would be
beaten back readily enough, for the tumult already extended
beyond the fortress and was penetrating the town.</p>

<p>Roderic would have felt inclined to laugh but for the
seriousness of the occasion&mdash;it was like a child and a
stack of cards pitched on end&mdash;a touch of the first sends
the whole pack falling; or a spark of fire coming in contact
with a train of gunpowder&mdash;so the shouting passed
from street to street and San Juan was racked with
the commotion.</p>

<p>It was a big send off, at any rate, and those responsible
for it could possibly find some future satisfaction in
knowing that San Juan had not received such a shock
since that early May morning when Sampson stirred
things up with his war terrors of the sea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>

<p>By rare good luck the fugitives managed to get down
from the break in the massive wall without any serious
accident.</p>

<p>Several times one would stumble as a portion of the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">debris</i> slipped under foot, or the tangle of the moon-flower
vines tripped them up; but these little accidents
bore no result.</p>

<p>Once upon <em>terra firma</em> Roderic knew what he had arranged
was all very well, but if Cleo had sent Captain
Beven to the rescue, his boat might after all be more
advantageously located than the one Owen had in mind.</p>

<p>"To the left!" said Georgia, breathing heavily, for the
task just finished had been a severe one.</p>

<p>Of course that meant that Beven was waiting near by,
and Roderic was fully content to let events drift him
from now on.</p>

<p>Hardly had they gone a dozen paces than the bluff
English sailor showed up.</p>

<p>Perhaps he was surprised at discovering the presence
of Roderic, who made his identity known immediately,
but if so no one knew it, for Beven was a matter of
fact old fellow, who took things as they came.</p>

<p>The flight was hastily resumed&mdash;indeed, it would have
been madness to have halted any length of time with
such signs of an aroused military power all around them.</p>

<p>Beven had assumed the lead, and as he was supposed
to have his bearings, so that the shortest route to the
boat could be taken Roderic was only too glad to resign
the whole affair into his hands.</p>

<p>It was at this critical juncture, when hope began to
rise strongly in their hearts, that a new element was injected
into the game.</p>

<p>Jerome and Captain Shackelford had indeed made a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
strong guess as to the mission of Beven and the disguised
Georgia.</p>

<p>When they finally lost them in the neighborhood of
the old fortress, Shackelford had suggested that they
visit the Spanish barracks not far away, and talk the matter
over with the colonel in charge, who was an old friend
of the sea captain.</p>

<p>Thus, when the alarm broke out, they surmised that
Beven had something to do with it, and accompanied
by a file of soldiers, posted in hot haste toward the spot.</p>

<p>It was our friends' misfortune to meet them on the
way.</p>

<p>There were no means of hiding&mdash;indeed, the hostile
squads discovered each other at about the same moment.</p>

<p>What made it the more aggravating was the fact that
the soldiers were directly between them and the bay&mdash;just
a little beyond could be seen the dimpled water, flashing
in the glorious light of the moon.</p>

<p>What was to be done?</p>

<p>Retreat had been rendered impossible, for Roderic was
so confused by the several turns taken that he would not
have known how to reach his boat.</p>

<p>To surrender meant ignominious death.</p>

<p>An Anglo-Saxon could not dream of submitting to
such disgrace while one door yet remained open.</p>

<p>That door was a gallant charge.</p>

<p>Beven knew his nation was not at war with Spain,
but his sympathies were wholly with those who spoke the
same tongue&mdash;blood is thicker than water, and with
prophetic wisdom he like many of his race, saw signs in
the air to indicate that the time was coming when Great
Britain and her colonies would stand fast with the great
Republic against the rest of the world&mdash;<em>for peace!</em></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>

<p>Therefore he was ready to step in, this gallant son of
Neptune who had seen many a hot engagement under
the flag of St. George.</p>

<p>"We must cut through or all is lost!" cried Roderic,
clinching his teeth in anticipation of the hot time that
was coming.</p>

<p>"Good. I'm with you!" snapped the sailor, grimly.</p>

<p>Leon had been armed and was eager for the fray&mdash;eager
to strike a blow because of the suffering and indignities
put upon him by these Spanish tories who loved
not Porto Rico.</p>

<p>"Forward, then, and God defend the right!"</p>

<p>Roderic had hardly spoken before they were once again
in motion, having involuntarily halted at first sight of
the foe.</p>

<p>As the Spaniards had also started forward, the two
hostile bodies were advancing toward each other with a
rapidity that promised to speedily bring them into contact.</p>

<p>Roderic's martial spirit was fully awakened.</p>

<p>He only feared for the devoted girl who clung so
closely to him&mdash;on her account he was like a lion aroused,
and all thought of pity for those against whom they must
come in battle array vanished from his heart.</p>

<p>Beven knew the advantage that must accrue from a
hot fire delivered before the others thought of opening
the engagement.</p>

<p>"Altogether&mdash;make it warm for the dagoes!" he said,
swinging his right arm on a level.</p>

<p>Then flashes of fire leaped out, and the rattle of revolvers
sounded like giant hail stones beating on an enormous
kettle.</p>

<p>It was a perfect cyclone of lead that whipped along
that narrow street leading to the bay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>

<p>Hardly a shot was wasted.</p>

<p>Confusion and consternation seemed to overwhelm the
Spaniards.</p>

<p>Brave men they may have been, but there is a limit to
endurance, a time when panic sweeps <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'irrisistibly'">irresistibly</ins> through
the mind, and each individual feels that he is the only one
remaining alive of many.</p>

<p>So it was no doubt here.</p>

<p>The hurricane of missiles had done considerable damage,
but the abruptness and violence with which the
storm burst upon them was of even more value in completing
the utter demoralization of the Spaniards.</p>

<p>Jerome and Shackelford were the only ones left standing
in the street when the <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'fusilade'">fusillade</ins> ceased, and the captain
had but one leg left upon which he could rely.</p>

<p>Wellington had thrown both arms into the air as a
token that his teeth were drawn and that he surrendered.</p>

<p>"To the boat!" said Captain Beven, knowing that a
thousand Spanish soldiers would be on the spot ere ten
minutes had passed.</p>

<p>Although this round had been so gloriously won he
knew they still had a hard row to hoe ere success could
be assured.</p>

<p>Still, when were brave hearts of the Saxon race dismayed
by even overwhelming odds&mdash;the record of many
a fierce battle fought on European, Asian, African and
American fields bears testimony of their dauntless grit.</p>

<p>Jerome's attitude would have been ludicrous at any
other time&mdash;he seemed desirous of raising his arms to
their highest possible level.</p>

<p>"You have won&mdash;you deserve success&mdash;I have had
enough&mdash;count me out, and good luck go with the whole
of you!" was what he bawled as they passed him by.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p>The tiger's claws had been trimmed.</p>

<p>Shackelford was not so magnanimous&mdash;he had a game
leg that would trouble him no doubt for the rest of his
life, and his benediction was in the shape of some hot
blasphemy that doubtless eased his soul more or less.</p>

<p>It was a strange parting from the villain of the play&mdash;but
then Jerome was after all only an adventurer whose
maxim it was to sip honey from the beautiful flowers, and
leave dangerous briars alone.</p>

<small>WHEN THE SPANISH FLAG LEFT PORTO RICO FOREVER.</small></h2>


<p>Another short run would take them to the water's
edge where a boat awaited, and sturdy English muscles
were eager to row them to safety.</p>

<p>Captain Beven had taken the precaution to make Spaniards
out of his men and himself, in the expectation that
such a conceit might avail to save Cleo future trouble;
for such an event as this could easily be made the foundation
of an international dispute, and the Spanish government
find just cause to demand damages from John
Bull.</p>

<p>Down the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">calle</i> they went, in the midst of shouts and
execrations from a myriad of heads that protruded from
the windows on either side.</p>

<p>That the owners neither knew what was in the wind
nor cared a <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">peseta</i> was a foregone conclusion; but they
could not resist giving tongue after the manner of their
kind and according to the stripe of their belief.</p>

<p>It was a hot finish.</p>

<p>Roderic did not breathe easily until they reached the
boat.</p>

<p>Then he began to believe there was a strong chance
for boarding the yacht.</p>

<p>It would not be a walk over, for pursuit had been inaugurated,
and the shouts of the angry soldiery rang
down the narrow street.</p>

<p>The embarkation was speedily accomplished&mdash;indeed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
almost like magic they found themselves in the boat, the
sailors sprang after, oars were unshipped and the shore
left behind.</p>

<p>What a p&aelig;an of thanksgiving seemed to arise in
Owen's heart when he saw the long prayed for consummation
of their hopes accomplished&mdash;as the shore receded,
each stroke of the oars appeared like a measure in
the glad anthem that swelled upward from his very soul.</p>

<p>For success meant to him more than life&mdash;he had
fought <em>for love</em>, and Paradise opened wide her doors.</p>

<p>Then he cast an anxious look above&mdash;oh, pale moon,
sailing so serenely athwart the heavens, show yet again
your sympathy and gentle mercy by veiling that bright
face behind some friendly cloud&mdash;it were worth a king's
ransom to have this occur, but it was vouchsafed them
without money and without price.</p>

<p>The moon dipped out of sight behind a black, ragged
mass of clouds, and the bay of San Juan was for the time
being wrapped in semi-gloom. Even Providence seemed
on their side.</p>

<p>When the Spanish soldiers reached the water's edge
they fired at random, but none of the missiles came anywhere
near them in the boat.</p>

<p>Faster rowed the British tars, knowing full well that
boats must already have put out in pursuit, and delay
meant trouble.</p>

<p>Roderic cast many an anxious glance up toward that
section of the heavens where moon and cloud were having
a royal warfare, and he was delighted to discover that
the former would evidently be discounted in the battle&mdash;at
least the reign of the cloud would last until they had
reached the Dreadnaught and were sheltered by her bulk
from searching eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span></p>

<p>So it happened.</p>

<p>One and all had gained her deck and the boat was
hauled up to the davits ere the face of fair Luna peeped
inquisitively forth.</p>

<p>Looking toward the shore they saw a dozen boats, all
occupied by Spanish soldiers in pursuit of a little sailboat
or sloop that, taking advantage of the night wind was
endeavoring to slip out of the harbor, being possibly a
smuggler engaged in defying the severe duties placed upon
all imports by Spanish laws.</p>

<p>Fortune seemed never to tire of aiding their cause&mdash;it
was one chance in a thousand that this smuggler should
start just at such a moment, and divert the attention of
the enraged Spaniards.</p>

<p>Perhaps, however, a guilty conscience had something
to do with the matter, for those on board the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">contrabandista</i>
boat must have believed the tremendous row
ashore had to do with their presence in the bay, and
spreading their white wings they had flown seaward.</p>

<p>Several volleys were fired after them by the soldiers,
and there came a deep boom or two later announcing
that the fort commanding the entrance to the bay had
taken a few chances at the escaping boat; but the moon
had again plunged behind the clouds, and besides, those
on board the sloop knew every foot of the offing so that
the way to escape was open.</p>

<p>But Roderic, even though the yacht was in motion, and
there was more or less danger of a bombardment from
the forts, had lost all interest in the result.</p>

<p>He was hovering over the berth where they had laid
Georgia, for upon reaching the deck the girl had fainted
in his arms&mdash;she had been wounded, perhaps by the
glancing bullet that came from the guard's Mauser when
he took his last shot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<p>All were dismayed to discover it, and Roderic felt a
dumb anguish creeping over his heart as he awaited the
doctor's report.</p>

<p>It was a serious wound, with the chances against her
surviving in such a warm climate.</p>

<p>The truth almost paralyzed poor Roderic&mdash;for this
had he labored, that Leon should be saved and his sister
yield up her bright young life?</p>

<p>Heaven alone knows what he suffered during the
weary hours of suspense.</p>

<p>When the dread summons came and he knew he had
lost her, the awful nature of the blow almost crushed him.</p>

<p>For once in his life he felt like cursing the Providence
that rules over all.</p>

<p>Georgia passed away with her arm about his neck, her
head pillowed on his breast, and her last whispered words
were:</p>

<p>"How I love you, my Roderic&mdash;do not quite forget the
poor daughter of Porto Rico!"</p>

<p>As if he could forget&mdash;so long as life remained her
image must always be enshrined in his heart.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was just as well for his future happiness&mdash;love
like Georgia's, so hot and inflammable, does not always
bring that peace and content of mind which most
men who speak the English tongue desire as their portion&mdash;it
would mean an iceberg, a volcano&mdash;cold one hour and
scorching the next.</p>

<p>Yes, perhaps Providence ordered it for the best.</p>

<p>And Georgia who seemed gifted with unusually clear
vision, Georgia must have realized this, for had she not
placed Cleo's hand in his, and solemnly declared that it
was her dying wish he should in due time take this fair
blue-eyed cousin for his own.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>

<p>At first in the keen anguish of his grief Roderic scarcely
gave this a second thought, but later on it loomed up before
his vision as he saw how Cleo avoided him and how
she blushed furiously whenever he glanced at her.</p>

<p>Thus he knew an explanation was absolutely necessary,
and not being the man to avoid duty he had a long
interview with his cousin.</p>

<p>It was arranged that Roderic should go away, after
poor Georgia had been buried near Ponce, (where Leon
decided should be the final resting place of his devoted sister,)
and not see Cleo again for six months&mdash;if at the end
of that time he could come to her and honestly confess a
positive growth of the love he had always entertained for
her, she would consent to become his wife.</p>

<p>That was all.</p>

<p>They had not been interfered with in leaving San Juan
harbor, and a safe landing was made on the southern
shore of Porto Rico where the stars and stripes already
floated over the land that fate intended should be one of
the fairest gems upon Columbia's diadem.</p>

<p>After the simple ceremony that marked the funeral of
the beautiful girl, Roderic thought life was a blank to
him.</p>

<p>He joined one of the armies of occupation and saw some
hot service as the boys in blue advanced across the island
toward San Juan, always driving the Spaniards before,
yet each day finding the task more difficult.</p>

<p>Utterly reckless in his present state of mind, Roderic
rushed into the jaws of death once too often&mdash;if his mad
desire was to follow his poor Georgia across the borders
of eternity he came very near accomplishing it one day
when, with a few chosen spirits he cleared a rocky eminence
of Spanish bushwhackers lying in wait for the Yankee
advance guard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<p>The field doctor actually gave him up for lost, but he
was carried back to the town of Ponce in an old <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">volante</i>
found at a farmer's, relic of days long gone by, and not
the most comfortable vehicle of transportation in the
world for a pain-racked hero, but infinitely better than
nothing.</p>

<p>Here, in the hospital they found that he had one chance
in a dozen if carefully nursed, and behold, who should
appear at the side of his cot but Cleo, the girl he had believed
a thousand miles away on pleasure bent; yes Cleo,
who, finding there was need of nurses to look after the
sick and wounded heroes among the Regulars and Volunteers,
"her own boys" as she called them, had quickly
chosen to let the voyage wait and devote herself to the
ministration of angelic duties.</p>

<p>How they worshiped her, those wounded and fever
stricken fellows to whom her presence brought such comfort
as she wrote letters, read cheering words and waited
upon them.</p>

<p>Many a heart asked Heaven's choicest blessings to follow
her.</p>

<p>And Cleo had her reward when she found Roderic on a
cot of pain.</p>

<p><ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Her's'">Hers</ins> was the blessed hand that sustained him, <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'her's'">hers</ins>
the cheery face that bending above gave him new desire to
live.</p>

<p>Of course he survived, else had this over true tale
never been written; but it was a hard struggle, and the
good army surgeon solemnly assured Roderic he had positively
been a dead man only for the unremitting and gentle
care of his sweet nurse.</p>

<p>It was so ordered by Divine Providence.</p>

<p>Roderic found out the truth&mdash;found that he did really<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
and sincerely love this brave girl from Virginia, not with
the tempestuous affection such as he had felt for Georgia,&mdash;no
woman on earth could ever again arouse such a
passion within his heart, but with a steadfast zeal that
must grow with the passage of time until it became the
sum and total of his existence.</p>

<p>By the time Roderic was well enough to be moved San
Juan had come into the hands of the Americans, a protocol
having been signed anticipating peace between the two
nations, now at war for the first time in their history.</p>

<p>Porto Rico was a part of the United States&mdash;the days
of Spain's dominion had passed and would return no
more.</p>

<p>It was necessary that Roderic be moved north, for recovery
would be more rapid in a cooler, bracing atmosphere.</p>

<p>Cleo's beautiful steam yacht still lay in the harbor
awaiting her pleasure.</p>

<p>No one may ever know who suggested the thing, but
that mattered little, since such a union was a foregone
conclusion; but one day a little ceremony was performed
in Roderic's room at the hotel, and Cleo changed her name&mdash;Miss
Fairfax of Virginia was no more&mdash;enter Mrs.
Roderic Owen.</p>

<p>Thus Roderic brushed all scruples aside&mdash;as the husband
of the owner of the yacht he could sail in her forever
without arousing comment.</p>

<p>Weak as he was he and Cleo drove to the grave of his
lost love and mingled their tears with the beautiful flowers
they spread upon it.</p>

<p>No, Roderic could never forget her&mdash;he would be less
than a man to dream of trying, and no doubt once in a
while a yearning would arise in his heart that could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
be kept down, for in imagination he could feel her arms
about his neck, her passionate kisses upon his lips.</p>

<p>But that will come and go as a vague dream.</p>

<p>His wife is the sweetest and noblest woman in all the
wide world, her devotion to him is the envy of all his
bachelor friends and Roderic declares himself the happiest
benedict in existence.</p>

<p>To Cleo the memory of Georgia is sacred, and she often
brings up the subject herself, being singularly free from
jealousy.</p>

<p>Roderic met Julio in Ponce at the time he was saying
good-bye to Leon and his wife; the ex-<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">toreador</i> and beau
of San Juan was thinking of migrating to Spain, since he
could not hope to win many fresh laurels in a land where
the stars and stripes waved, and where men had a stern
code of morals for such sad flirts as he.</p>

<p>Of General Porfidio, Roderic had seen quite considerable
while in the hospital, and the old warrior will always
have a warm place in Roderic's heart; nor can he ever
forget that awful duel with swords in the East India
bungalow of Rathmines road, Dublin.</p>

<p>As for Jerome, doubtless he is working the European
capitals&mdash;perhaps should he meet one Joel Darby on his
rounds, the latter might kindly give him points concerning
the combination with which he broke the bank at
Monte Carlo.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
